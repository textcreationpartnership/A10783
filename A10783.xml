            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST gratious Soueraigne, ſince it hath pleaſed your Maieſtie of your Princely care towards the Church, and your common wealth, to take knowledge of ſome differences that are in Iudicature betweene your Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuile Law, and the Temporall Law of this Land (by which ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Maieſties State is managed next after your owne moſt rare prouidence, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſuch, whom it hath pleaſed your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to aſſociat vnto your ſelfe in the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of your Kingdome) I haue bin bold to offer vnto your Maieſtie this ſimple Treatiſe, as
<pb facs="tcp:16472:3"/>
that which doth lay out the cauſe of thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences more particulerly than any man hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath expreſſed the ſame. In comming to which (becauſe I doe ſpeake for thoſe parts of your Maieſties Laws, which are leſſe knowen vnto your people, and eſteemed no otherwiſe of them than they ſee the practiſe thereof to be here within your Land) I haue thought good, as it were in a briefe, to ſet out the whole ſum of both the Lawes to the view of the people, that they may ſee there is more worth in thoſe for whom I ſpeake, than was by many concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be: ſo that the profeſſion of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall and Ciuile Law may appeare to the world, neither to be ilde nor vnfit for the State; ſo far as it hath pleaſed the Royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of your Highneſſe to giue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto it, and your Maieſtie your ſelfe to admit of it. In al which there is no other thing ſought, than that ſuch grieuances as haue bin of late offered by one Iuriſdiction vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in conſequence, to all your ſubiects, who follow any ſuits in the Ciuile or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Courts, may by your Princely wiſdome be conſidered, and by your authoritie be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, if they be found to be grieuances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
<pb facs="tcp:16472:3"/>
for now as things are, neither Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowes their owne bounds, but one ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth from the other, in maner, as in a batable ground lying betweene two Kingdomes; but ſo that the weaker euer goeth to the worſe, and that which is mightier preuailes againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the profeſſors thereof being rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue Lawes and interpretations to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to take or admit of any againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For which, the weaker appeales vnto your Highneſſe, humbly deſiring your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties vpright and ſincere Iudgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne where the wrong is, and to redreſſe it accordingly, which is a worke worthy your Maieſties high conſideration. For as the Land is yours, ſo alſo the Sea is yours, &amp; the Church is vnder your Highneſſe protection, as a child is vnder his Tutor; ſo that all the Lawes therof appertaine vnto your Maieſties care and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort alike: For which, not onely the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuile Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers that now are, but thoſe which ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in thoſe places for euer hereafter vnto the worlds end, will praiſe and magnifie your Maieſties gratious fauour towards them, and wee that now are will pray to God for the

long and happie proſperitie of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and your poſteritie ouer vs, during the continuance of this Heauen and this Earth, and after the paſſing away therof, a perpetual fruition of the new Heauen and the new Earth, wherein righteouſneſſe onely ſhall dwell for euer.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, I confeſse, as I meditated this Treatiſe vpon mine owne motion (as I doe ſometimes matters of other argument, when my leaſure ſerues me thereto) ſo alſo I doe not ſet it out to the view of the world vpon mine owne motion, but was deſirous it ſhould haue bin keept in, ſauing that I muſt obey where I am bound. The thing that gaue me cauſe to this meditation, was, that I ſaw many times how meanly men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſticall Law of this Land, valuing them by the practiſe of ſo much of them, as we haue among vs. And therefore I thought good, although not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vnfold the riches of them, yet to make ſhew of them folded vp, in ſuch ſort as Mercers make ſhew of their ſilkes and veluets, laid vp in whole peeces in their ſhops; whereby it may be ſeene what great varietie they haue of all theſe kind of wares, although the goodneſſe of the ware it ſelfe cannot be diſcerned, becauſe it is foulded vp: Beſide, ſeeing how freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prohibitions are in theſe daies in cauſes of either cogniſance more than haue bin in former time, I thought it not vnworthy my labour to inquire and ſee vpon what iuſt grounds they are raiſed vp in this multitude; not of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour I haue to gaine ſay the lawfull proceedings of any court (which I reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; moſt readily acknowledge their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in all things belonging to their place) but to know and ſearch out the truth of thoſe ſuggeſtions that giue cauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe prohibitions. For whenas ſuch Lawes as are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:16472:5"/>
of theſe buſineſſes, are written indifferently as well for the one Iuriſdiction as the other, no man is to be offended, if the one Iuriſdiction finding it ſelfe preſſed by the partial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation (as it ſuppoſeth) of the other, inquire the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſuch interpretation, &amp; labour to redreſſe it if it may be, by the right interpretation therof: To the end that either Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may reteine their owne right, &amp; not the one be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt by the other, as it ſeemeth to be at this day: And that in ſuch matters (as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue) of their owne right, as depend of no other authoritie but of the Prince alone: which is the thing only that is ſought in this little Treatiſe. And therfore the Reuerend Iudges of this Land are to be intreated, that they will vouchſafe an equal interpretation of theſe matters as well to the one Iuriſdiction as the other, for ſo it is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them to doe; and if they doe it not the other are not ſo dull ſenced, but they can perceiue it, nor ſo daunted, but that they can fly for ſuccour vnto him, to whoſe high place and wiſdome, the deciding of theſe differences doth of right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. <hi>PENELOPE</hi> is ſaid to haue had many wooers comely in perſon and eloquent in ſpeech, but ſhe reſpected none but her owne <hi>VLISSES.</hi> Such ſhould be the mind of a Iudge, that whatſoeuer other apparance or ſhew of truth be offered, one ſaying this is the true ſence of the Law, and another that; yet the Iudge ſhould reſpect none but the very true germane and genuine ſence thereof indeed. Which if it were religiouſly or indifferently obſerued in euery Court, then needed not this complaint that now is, but euery Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhould peaceably hold his owne right, ſuch as the Prince, Law, or Cuſtome hath afforded vnto it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I ſhew how neceſſarie it is for his Maieſtie and the Realme, to maintaine the Ciuile and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Law, as they are now practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among vs in this Realme, I will ſet down as it were in a briefe, what the Ciuile and the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes are: then will I ſhew how farre forth they are here in vſe and practiſe among vs: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherein we are abridged and put beſide the vſe and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof, by the Common Lawe, euen contrarie to the old practiſe thereof, and the true ſence and meaning of the Lawes of this Realme and the Statutes in this behalfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided: and laſtly, wherein we might be relieued and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the practiſe of many things in the Ciuile Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to the Common Lawe; and ſo both the Lawes might know their owne grounds and proper ſubiects, and not one to be iumbled with the other as it is at this day, to the great vexation of the Subiect. But before I ſpeake of the Ciuile Law in particuler, I will define what Right or Law is in genetall: Law therefore is (as <hi>Vlpian</hi> ſaith, <hi>L.</hi> 10. <hi>in fin ff. de Iusticia &amp; Iure)</hi> the knowledge of Ciuile, and humane things, the vnderſtanding of thoſe things which are iuſt vniuſt. This Law is primarily diuided into the lawe publicke and the lawe priuate. The publicke, is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16472:10"/>
that which appertaineth to the generall ſtate of the common wealth, for I meane the law publick, not in reſpect of the forme, that they were publickly made, as we make lawes in our Parliaments, for ſo all the Ciuile Law is publicke, as made by publicke authoritie; but in reſpect of the obiect or end therof, for that they concerne the Church, the Clergie, the Magiſtrate, and other like publicke functions, none of which leuell at the rule of equitie, or equalitie betwéene man and man, as priuat lawes doe, but ayme at that which is moſt fit in generall for the common State.</p>
            <p>The priuat Law, or the priuat mens Law, is that which concernes euery ſingular mans ſtate, which, for that it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in giuing euery man his owne, it muſt of neceſſitie be proportionable to the rule of Equalitie and Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Priuate Law, is of thrée ſorts, the law of Nature, the law of Nations, and the law Ciuile.</p>
            <p>The law of Nature, is that which Nature hath taught euery liuing creature, as the care and defence of euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures life, deſire of libertie, the coniunction of male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male for procreation ſake.</p>
            <p>The law of Nations, is that which common reaſon hath eſtabliſhed among men, and is obſerued alike in al Nations, as diſtinctions of mens rights, building of houſes, erecting of Cities, ſocietie of life, iudgements of controuerſies, war, peace, captiuitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts, obligations, ſucceſſion, &amp; ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The law Ciuile, being largely taken, is the law that euery particuler Nation frameth to it ſelfe, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> laws, and the lawes of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> in which ſence alſo, the law of England may be called the Ciuile law, for that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and priuat law of this Nation: but in more ſtrict ſort, the Ciuile law is the law, which the old <hi>Romanes</hi> vſed, and is for the great wiſdom &amp; equitie therof at this day, as it were, the common law of all well gouerned Nations, a very few only excepted.</p>
            <p>And certainly, albeit ſundry other Nations by the light of Nature, haue many Rules &amp; Maxims of the Ciuile law: yet, if all the conſtitutions, cuſtoms, &amp; lawes, of all other people
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16472:10"/>
and countries were put together (I except none, ſaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laws of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which came immediatly from God) they are not comparable to the law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> neither in wiſdom nor equitie, neither in grauitie nor in ſufficiencie.

driuen away from their lawful defence: how perſons of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon truſt, as Marriners, Inholders, and ſuch like, are bound by Lawe to reſtore ſuch things as they haue taken in charge to kéepe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond parte, being diſtributed into viij. bookes, yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth matter of Iudgement, as who may be Iudge and who not: where and before what Iudge euery one is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: how many kindes of Iudgement there are, Ciuile, Criminall, and mixt of both: by what actions things that are ours by right of inheritance may be chalenged, whether they be corporall or incorporall, what action the Lawe affordes, if any man conceale that is ours, that we may come to the ſight thereof: what action lyeth againſt him who by euill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions or leude inticement hath corrupted another mans ſeruant, or hauing run away by his ill counſell, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed him from his maſter: what prouiſion the Lawe hath againſt Dice-play and ſuch as kéepe Dicing houſes: how he is to be puniſhed which being put in truſt to meaſure any mans ground, makes a falſe report of the meaſure thereof: that no man hinder a corſe of a dead bodie to be carried to buriall, or to be buried in ſuch places as he and his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors haue right vnto, or to build a Tombe to that purpoſe, and beautifie the ſame.</p>

The fourth part being digeſted into eight bookes, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth actions for ſuch things as are acceſſarie to contracts, ſuch as pawnes and pledges are, which are giuen for the better ſecuritie of the contract: actions for reſtitution wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man hath béene deceiued in a bargaine more then the halfe value of the thing ſold, or wherein the ſeller hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſome fault in the thing ſold, which he ought by Law to haue reuealed, or promiſed ſome qualitie in the ſame, which was not in it, or where the thing ſold, hath béene euic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by an other, out of the hands of the buyer, himſelfe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all iuſt defence of Law for himſelfe: actions for intereſt and vſurie, and how many kinds thereof there bée that men vſe by land, lucratorie, compenſatorie, and punitorie; whereof the firſt is altogether vnlawfull, the other two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed where either iuſt gain ceaſeth, or iuſt loſſe followeth, vpon that occaſion, that which is lent is not paide according to the day of couenant. Sea vſurie, otherwiſe called nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick vſurie, is greater then land vſurie, and yet allowed by Law, for that the ſeafaring man takes vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the daunger of the tranſporting thereof, and ſecuring the ſame at ſuch place as it is appointed to be deliuered. In deciding of matters of controuerſie, the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeds ſometimes by witneſſes, ſometimes by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſometimes by preſumptions, where knowledge or ignorance of fact or Law is preſumed. Spouſals are mutuall promiſes of a future marriage: marriage is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coopling together of man and woman, the companie and ſocietie of the whole life, the Communion of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane rites and things, and of one and the ſame houſe, wrought by the conſent and mutuall good will of the one towards the other: in eſpouſals and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages is to bée conſidered, who is to bee ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at what yeares, and by whoſe conſent: there doth wayte and attend vpon Marriages, Ioyntures, Dowries, and ſuch like, and ſometimes Diuorſe, which is ſo called of the diuerſitie of the mindes of thoſe that are married; becauſe ſuch as are diuorſed goe one a

A Tutor is chiefly ſet ouer the perſon of the childe, ſecondly ouer his goods: but the Curator or Gardian is chiefly ſet ouer the goods, and then ouer the perſon of the child: children (their father being dead) by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of the Iudge, are to be brought vp with their mother, vnleſſe ſhe hath fled vnto a ſecond marriage, which if ſhe haue done, then is he to be brought vp with ſome of his néereſt kinne, ſuch as is knowne to be an honeſt man, and will haue a care of his good education; with whom the Iudge is to allowe him ſuch maintenance, as all his ſtock be not ſpent therein, but euermore ſomething be left againſt he come to full age. When the time of Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or curatorſhip is ended, they are to render accompt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iudge, what they haue receiued, and how they haue expended the ſame, and what reſidue is left, and according as their proofes are, either by oath, or otherwiſe, ſo the Iudge

If the Tutors or Curators proue bankrupt, or vnable to ſatiſfie the Pupill or Minor, then lieth an action againſt their ſuerties for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction of the ſame; and if both of them faile, then lieth it againſt the Iudge, or Magiſtrate, if either he haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any caution at all of the Tutors or Curators, or hath receiued an vnſufficient caution, or vnſufficient ſuerties, knowing them to be vnſufficient; otherwiſe he is not to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure fortune and future caſes of the child: the Tutors or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators are to ſell nothing of thoſe things that are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens, ſauing ſuch things which by kéeping cannot be kept, vnleſſe they haue the order or decrée of the Iudge thereunto, which the Iudge is not to decrée, vnleſſe the child be ſo far in debt that it cannot be ſatiſfied without ſelling ſome part of the other goods, or there be ſome other like iuſt and neceſſarie cauſe like vnto this which may not be auoided. As Minors haue curators and gouernors, ſo alſo mad perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall perſons are appointed to haue gouernors by law, for that they can no more gouerne their owne ſtate then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can.

ſufferance of an other, there lyeth an Iniunction for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of either of their poſſeſſion, called <hi>vti poſſidetis:</hi> That a man may vſe ſuch priuat way, as he hath vſed the yeare paſt, and repayre the ſame without interruption of an other: That no man turne away the daily running water, or the water which fals in Sommer from an other mans houſe, or ground to his hinderance: That water courſes in ryuers, and other like places be maintained: That ſuch as haue right to draw water out of any ſpring, or well, be not forbid the vſe thereof, and that euery one haue frée libertie to cleanſe, purge, and to repaire the ſame, if there be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in it: That no man be forbid to ſcoure, purge, or clenſe his priuies, ſincks, or vaults: That whatſoeuer is done by open force, or ſecret ſubtilty, be reſtored into place it was, before ſuch force or ſubtilty was done, vnleſſe the partie grieued releaſe the ſame: That he that holdes any thing at an other mans will, reſtore the ſame vpon competent war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or knowledge giuen him thereof: That a man may lop or cut the boughes of an other mans trée annoying his ground, if after warning giuen thereof, the owner thereof do not reforme it. That it be lawful for a man to gather ſuch fruits of his, as fall from his owne trée into an other mans ground, without any treſpas to the owner of the ground, ſo that he gather the ſame within thrée dayes after they are ſo falne; for otherwiſe the law preſumes he makes no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and fruites lying vpon the ground doe eaſily putrifie: That a man may challenge his children out of an other mans hand that holdeth them from him: That a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant after his Leaſe is expyred may remoue &amp; quietly carry away ſuch things from the farme, as he brought thither, ſo that the rent be paied, and thoſe things which he brought thither were not bound for the paiment thereof. Actions are taken away, and poſſeſſions maintayned by exceptions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, &amp; preiudices, which themſelues are many times in ſtéed of actions, as is the exception <hi>de re indicata,</hi> which is an exception that determineth the cauſe in controuerſie. Of Exceptions, ſome are perpetuall and peremptory, ſome are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16472:16"/>
temporal and dilatory; Perpetuall and peremptory are they which euermore haue place &amp; can nerer be auoyded; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and dilatory are they which are not euermore in place, but may be auoided: Exceptions are alleaged either becauſe that is done which ought to be done, or that is done that ought not to be done, or that is not done that ought to be done. Of preſcriptions likewiſe ſome are perpetuall, ſome temporall; the effect of eyther of them is to determine the actioney ther in the maner of doing, or by the time when it was done, or by the place where it was done, or by ſome other like circumſtance.</p>
            <p>An Obligation is a bond of the Law, whereby a man is neceſſarily bound to pay ſome thing to an other man: Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ariſe eyther out of bargaines betwéene man &amp; man, or out of ſome offence that is done: Obligations by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines are procured eyther by ſome thing that paſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the parties, that doe contract, or elſe is effected by words, or conſent. Out of obligations ſpring actions, which are nothing elſe but a right to proſecute that in iudgement which a man pretendeth to be due vnto him, whereof there are two ſorts; of which one is a challenge for right of a thing due, thother a ſute againſt a perſon for ſome offence or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas done.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth &amp; laſt part being deuided into ſixe Bookes, treateth of Obligations which ſtand in wordes, and their effect; how far two or more principall debtors are bound to the creditor, in the whole, or euery one for his owne part: Of Suerties, and how far they are bound, and whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the one be the releaſe of the other: &amp; by how many waies Obligations by wordes are diſſolued or releaſed, by renouation, by payment, by acceptation of the debt not paid, as if it were paid. Of Obligations ſome are ciuill, as thoſe which haue béene heretofore handled, ſome Pretorian or pertayning to the Chauncery, as thoſe whereby Tutors, Curators, &amp; Proctors, enter inte land vnto a child, his ſtate ſhall be ſafe, that is committed to their hands: That, that ſhall be paied which the Iudge ceaſeth: That the Plaintife
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16472:17"/>
ſhall ratifie and allowe that which his Proctor ſhall doe for him, in iudgement, and ſuch like. Criminall Iudgements are priuat or publike, that is, they are commenced eyther vpon priuat offences, or vpon publike faults and ſuits. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat offences concerne priuat mens reuenge and iniuries. Publike, the reuenge or iniurie of the whole ſtate. Priuat offences which had ordinarie procéedings, and ordinatie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, were many, among which Theft is the chiefeſt, which is a deceitfull fingering of an other mans goodes, with intent to gaine eyther the thing it ſelfe, or the vſe or poſſeſſion thereof, ſo that the mind alone maketh not theft, but the act ioyned to the mind, be the quantity neuer ſo ſmal. Of Theftes, ſome are manifeſt, other not manifeſt; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt is that wherein the offender is eyther taken in the déed doing, or taken before he could cary away the thing ſtolne thither whether he entended: the puniſhment whereof was fower double the value of that, which was ſtolne: Not manifeſt was that wherein the party offending was not taken in the déed doing, and the paine thereof was the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that which was purloyned, or taken away. If any pilfery or theft be done in a Ship, Tauerne, or Inne, the Maſter of the ſhip, tauerne, or Inne, is to anſwere double the value thereof, if the ſame be done by himſelfe, or their ſelues, or any of their mariners or ſeruants: for it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to haue honeſt men, whom they are to imploy in ſuch ſeruices: But if it be done by any of the paſſengers, or gueſts of the houſe, the owners of the ſhip, tauerne, or Inne, are not to anſwere for the ſame, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turne away ſuch gueſts as come into their houſe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all likelyhood know they the qualitie or condition of their gueſts. If any man priuely, vnwitting the owner thereof, cut downe, hacke, or barke any trée of any ſort whatſoeuer, or thoſe that are of the nature of trées, as Iuey réedes, willows, ſo that they be ſpoyled, he is to anſwere the double value of that he hath cut downe &amp; ſpoiled: and further, if it be a Vine trée, to be puniſhed as a robber. He that taketh any thing away from another by violence, is to be puniſhed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16472:17"/>
in the worth foure fold, for that it is a ſin more grieuous then theft: If any man, vpon any ill intent, make a Tumult, wherby any hurt commeth to any man, hee ſhall anſwere double of that the party is harmed in: If any, vpon a burning of a houſe, or the fall thereof, or vpon a ſhipwrack, or the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a boat or ſhip, ſteale any thing away, or being put in truſt to kéepe any thing thereof, conceale the ſame, he ſhall pay the foure double of the ſame; but if any man ſet the ſame a fier himſelfe, he is either to be caſt out to wild beaſts, or is to be burnt with the ſame fier he went about to burn another with. If any haue ſpitefully contumeltouſly iniured ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man his wife, or children, in déed, word, or writing, they are to forfait ſo much as the partie grieued ſhall eſtéem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe iniured by, or the Iudge ſhall tax it at. A famous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell is where a man hath of malitious purpoſe writ, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, or ſet out any thing to the infamie of another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name, or with a name, and the puniſhment therof is death, and anciently was, that he loſt the power or libertie to make a Will; the like puniſhment followeth him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found an infamous Libell, doth not by and by ſpoyle the ſame, that the knowledge thereof come not abroad, eſpecially where the matter thereof is capitall or worthy death. Extraordinarie crimes, are thoſe which haue no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie puniſhment appointed them, but are arbitrarie at the Iudges appointment, ſuch as are Sollicitors of other folkes wedlockes, and Maids chaſtities, although they miſſe of their purpoſe; ſuch as of purpoſe caſt myre, durt, or any like filth vpon another, to the intent to diſgrace him: ſuch, as being with child, of purpoſe cauſe themſelues to miſcarie: Such as kéepe brothell and baudy houſes, or other vnlawful company: Iuglers, and ſuch as carie about Snakes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Serpents and trumperie to put men in feare: Such as hide and ſuppreſſe Corne, to cauſe the price to be dearer: Such as eyther make, or vſe falſe waights wittingly; for all which, becauſe there is no proper puniſhment prouided in the Law, they are referred to the puniſhment of the Iudge, who is to puniſh them according to the qualitie of the fact,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16472:18"/>
age, and vnderſtanding of the offender, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances according as he ſhall thinke good; ſo, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he excéed not a conuenient meaſure therein, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtretch the ſame to death: but vpon ſome great and weightie cauſe, he is to be content with meaner puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as temporall baniſhment, whipping, or ſome moderat pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarie mulct. For violating or defacing another mans ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, Infamy was impoſed, beſides a pecuniarie mulct to be diuided betwéene the Prince and the partie grieued, but if any dig vp the corſe of the deceaſed, the puniſhment is death: If any, by feare of his office or authoritie, wring any money from any man, or exact more fées in any matter than hee ought to doe, or cauſe him to marry or doe any other thing he would not doe, the forfeiture is foure double the value of that which hath béene taken, beſide further puniſhment at the diſcretion of the Iudge. Such as driue mens cattell out of their ground, or ſeuer them from the flock or heard, with intent to ſteale them, if they doe it with a weapon like vnto a Robber, are condemned to bee throwne to wild beaſts, otherwiſe are more lightly puniſhed according to the diſcretion of the Iudge. Such as in Iudgement take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on both ſides, or taking vpon them, the defence of one ſide betray the cauſe and take money on the other ſide, are infamous by law, and are puniſhed at the diſcretion of the Iudge. Such as receiue théeues and other like malefactors are puniſhed, in like ſort as the théeues or malefactors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are; ſpecially if they haue aſſiſted them in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: otherwiſe, if they onely knew it and receiued them, they are more mildly to be puniſhed, ſpecially if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were their kinſmen: for their offence is not like theirs which entertaine thoſe which are no kin vnto them at all, when as it is naturall for euery one to regard his own blood: and fathers are many times more carefull for their children then for themſelues; but if that hee that receiued them knew nothing of the offence, then is hee altogether to be excuſed. Such as breake priſon are to bee puniſhed by death, becauſe it is a certaine treaſon to breake the Princes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16472:18"/>
ward, but if they ſcape by the negligence of the Kéepers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the preſumption lyeth euer in this caſe, they are more lightly to be puniſhed. If any commit Burglarie, breaking vp a dore or wall, with intent to doe a Robberie, if they be baſe companions they are to bee condemned to the Mines or Gallies; but if they be of better reckoning, they are to be put from the ranke or order wherein they are, or to be baniſhed for a ſeaſon. Iuglers and like Impoſtors which goe about deceiuing of the people with falſe tricks and toies, hookes and ſuch like, which inſinuat themſelues into other mens houſes, with purpoſe to ſteale, are puniſhed at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Iudge. If any ſteale or take away any thing out of the inheritance of another man, before either the Will be prooued, or adminſtration be taken; an action of theft lyeth not, becauſe the inheritance, during the time, was counted no bodies, but hee is to be puniſhed by the diſcretion of the Iudge; yea, though it were the heire himſelfe that did it. Coſenage, whereby a man craftily ſuppreſſeth ſomething he ſhould not, or putteth one thing in anothers place, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him that he dealeth withall, or corrupteth ſuch wares which hee vttereth, or doth any other thing colluſorily, which is called of the Law <hi>Crimen Stellionatus,</hi> of a little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min or creature called <hi>Stellio,</hi> much like to a Liſard, moſt enuious to man, is cenſured by ſome ignominious and ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full puniſhment, or by diſgracing the perſon, by putting him out of the Office, Place, or Order he is in, or by inioyning him ſome ſeruile worke, or by baniſhing him for a time, or by ſome like puniſhment, at the diſcretion of the Iudge. If any plough vp a Mere balke, or remooue any other marke which hath accuſtomed to bee a Marke or bound betwéene ground and grounds, which aunciently was counted reuerend and religious among men the offence is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed either by a pecuniarie mulct, or by baniſhment, or whipping, at the diſcretion of the Iudge. Vnlawfull Colledges, Corporations, and aſſemblies, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to bad vſes, as to eating, drinking, wantonneſſe, hereſie, conſpiracie, as puniſhed are publike Routs or Riots,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16472:19"/>
otherwiſe at the diſcretion of the Iudge: All theſe, before recited, are called Populer Actions, becauſe, not only he that is iniured, but euery other honeſt ſubiect may peruſe and proſecute the ſame.</p>
            <p>Publick Iudgements, are ſuch which immediatly pertain to the puniſhment of the common wealth for example ſake, and are examined, tried, and puniſhed by a publicke order appointed by Law, the partie grieued, making himſelfe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the ſuite, and following the ſame; the partie accuſed in the meane while remaining in priſon, or putting in ſuerties for his apparance, and the partie grieued for the proſecuting of the ſame. The chiefeſt of which ſort is Treaſon, which is a diminiſhing or derogation of the Maieſtie of the people, or Prince, on whom the people haue collated all their power, which is puniſhed with death, and confiſcation of the Lands and goods of the offender, and the eternall aboliſhment of his memorie. The next is Adultery, which is violating of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans bed, whoſe puniſhment aunciently was death, both in the man and in the woman, but after it was mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the woman, ſhe being firſt whipt, and then ſhut vp in a Monaſterie: but by the Canons, other paines are inflicted. Vnder Adulterie are contained, Inceſt, Sodomy, Baudery, and all the reſt of the ſins of that kind. Publicke force, is that which is done by a company of armed men, collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the correction thereof is perpetuall baniſhment. Priuat, which is done without Arms, the paine thereof is the loſſe of halfe the parties goods, and the infamie of his name. Murtherers and Poyſoners, Witches and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the crime being proued, dye the death: ſuch as ſet mens houſes a fire, are to be conſumed with fire themſelues: ſuch as Kill either Father or Mother, or thoſe that are in the place of Father or Mother, or any that are of next a kin, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is death; and in caſe of the Father and Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the paine of death, the Parricide being firſt well whipt, ſo that the blood doe follow in good plenty, being ſowed vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſacke, together with a Dong, a Cock, and an Ape, hee is throwne into the depth of the Sea. Such as make falſe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificats,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16472:19"/>
forge falſe Wils, Depoſe falſe wittingly, ſuborne witneſſes, take money either to ſay, or not to ſay their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which they are demaunded of in Iudgement, corrupt Iudgement, or cauſe it to be corrupted, interline, put in, or raſe out any thing out of any writing, that the trueth thereof may not appeare as it was written, ſuppreſſe Wils or Teſtaments, or other like writings, counterfait other mens hands and Seals, openeth any mans Wil yet liuing, and imparteth the ſecrets thereof to the parties aduerſarie, vnſealeth ſuch inſtruments or writings as are left with him to kéepe, bequeath vnto themſelues Legacies in an other mans Will without his good will and priuitie, waſh or clip gold or ſowder therein any corrupt mettals, make baſe ſiluer money, pretend themſelues to bee Noble men or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereas otherwiſe they are but baſe perſons, wilfully challenge vnto themſelues another mans name, or Arms, cog and foiſt in womens labours or otherwiſe, falſe births or Adulterous children, in ſtead of true and rightfull heires, ſell one and the ſame thing to two men, carrie about falſe Paſports, vſe falſe Meaſures, or corrupt thoſe that are true, in ſome caſes, are puniſhed by death, in other by baniſhment, impriſonment, or cutting of both or one of the hands of the offender. If any bearing any publike office, abuſe the ſame to gaine, and doth that for money which he ought to do for thanks; the Law ordereth that the offender ſhall be called to accompt for his ſuppoſed briberie, and if he bee found guiltie therof, fineth him foure fold double to the partie grieued, and beſide, decréeth him to be baniſhed. Such as by il deuiſes and policies, raiſe vp the price of corne, and other victuall, or get the whole ſale of any marchandiſe into their hands, that they may ſel it the dearer, are puniſhable at the diſcretion of the Iudge, which according to the qualitie of the perſon and fact reacheth ſometimes to baniſhment, ſometimes to death it ſelfe. If any take, purloine, or interuert to his owne vſe any money dedicated to holy and publicke vſes, or cauſe the ſame to be taken, purloyned or interuerted, or if any take away any braſen table, wherein any publicke Lawes are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16472:20"/>
grauen, or the bounds of any Lands are deſcribed, or blot out or change any thing therof, or couenouſly pay in leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Exchequer, then by right he ought to haue done, and hath not cléered with the Exchequer for the reſidue, is to be condemned in the thrée double of that which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue, and is beſide to be baniſhed.</p>
            <p>If any, to get an Office, procure a number of hyred voices, beſides the loſſe of the Office hee ſueth for, his puniſhment is temporall baniſhment. If any ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any child, the bodie of any fréeman, and ſell the ſame away, or detaine them againſt their will, the fault is death. If any ſlanderouſly charge another with any falſe crime, or wittingly beare any falſe witneſſe againſt him, or willingly giue any wrong Sentence againſt him, or on the contrarie ſide, diſſembleth ſuch faults as hee knoweth, and colludeth with the aduerſarie, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ouer the proſecution of a crime, hee hath vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to follow, vntill hee haue leaue graunted him by the Iudge, to deſiſt from his accuſation, the ſame is to bee puniſhed with the like kind of puniſhment that hee would haue the other puniſhed by, vnleſſe hee bee acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefro by the Princes Pardon, or that the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaris bee dead. In publike Iudgements where the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender appeares not, Proces is to bee awarded out againſt gainſt him for his apparance, by a certaine day to cléere himſelfe, at which day, if hee appeare not, an Inuentory is taken of his goods, not to the intent they ſhould be ſpent but that they ſhould be reſerued to his vſe, if he returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine within a yeare, and cléere himſelfe; otherwiſe they become the Exchequers for euer, how innocent ſoeuer the partie afterwards appeares to bee. If the Offender be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Iudgement, and deny the fact, he is to be confuted by witneſſes, or other proofe, or if there be iuſt matter of ſuſpition, to bee put on the racke; which, albeit in matters of leſſe daunger, it is great crueltie, yet in great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crimes it is neceſſarie: If the Offender haue either confeſſed the crime, or be conuicted thereof, then it followeth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16472:20"/>
that the partie conuicted, be puniſhed either by death or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, according to the qualitis of the perſon, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the offence. Puniſhments by death are foure, Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Burning, Heading, and Caſting the Offender to be deuoured by wild beaſtes, amongſt which may be reckoned, Exile or Baniſhment, for that it takes away a mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and bereaues him of his country, which to euery good ſubiect, is as deare vnto him as his life it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Puniſhments which did not inflict death, were many, and ſuch as it pleaſed the Magiſtrat in his diſcretion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. The Law hauing paſſed vpon the Offender in ſuch ſort, as he hath loſt his life, libertie, or countrie, his goods became forthwith forfaited to the Prince, ſuch (I meane) as are of value: but for the other, the Law alloweth them the priſoner, for his maintenance during the time of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and ſatiſfying ſuch ſées as are due to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thereof; which hath place where the offender hath no children, otherwiſe the one halfe of his goods commeth to his children, vnleſſe it be in caſe of Treaſon where all is confiſcated. They are alſo held for conuict and guilty, which either vpon a guiltineſſe of minde make away themſelues before Iudgement, or ſtop their Aduerſaries with a bribe, that they ſhall not follow the Law againſt them, and their goods are no leſſe confiſcat then the others. But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in thoſe which are baniſhed for a time, or to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, or in ſuch as the Law hauing once paſſed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, are either in their life or after their death, by the bountie and mercie of the Prince reſtored; in which caſe they recouer Goods, Name, and Honour: the body being executed the carcaſſe for the moſt part is graunted to buriall, vnleſſe it be for matter of Treaſon or other ſuch like offence. If any haue bin vniuſtly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, either by the iniquitie or vnſkilfulneſſe of the Iudge, the law alloweth him an appeal, that is a prouocation to a higher Iudge, that he may hear the cauſe anew, &amp; reforme that which is Iudged amiſſe into bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and if the higher Iudge find the partie grieued, hath well appealed, he is to reuerſe the former ſentence, otherwiſe to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16472:21"/>
ſend the Offender back to the Iudge from whence he came, there to receiue his puniſhment: yet ſome perſons there be from whom no appeale lieth, as from the Prince, or Senat, becauſe they repreſent the Prince; neither may hee appeale which hath renounced his appeale. Appeales are made from lower Iudges to higher, and from him that is Delegated to him that did Delegate: Appeales are to be made within ten daies after Sentence giuen, or within ten daies after the Notice is come to the partie, againſt whom the Sentence did paſſe, vnleſſe there attend thereon a continuall griefe, in which caſe, a man may appeale ſo long as the griefe indures: the time to aſke Duniſſorie Letters, is thirtie daies from the Sentence giuen; the time to preſent the ſame to the Iudge, is at the diſcretion of the Iudge from whom; the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the ſame is a yeare, or vpon iuſt cauſe two yeares, in which time, if the ſute bee not ended, the cauſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and to be ſent back vnto the Iudge from whom the Appeale was firſt made: while the Appeale hangeth, nothing is to be innouated, becauſe by the Appeale the Iudges hands are, as it were, bound: but if the former Sentence were void by law, as in ſundry caſes they are, then there néedeth no Appeale; for ſuch Sentences neuer paſſe into a caſe Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Appeales in criminall caſes cannot be iuſtified by a Proctor; but it is otherwiſe in Ciuile cauſes. An Appeale in one cauſe doth not exempt the partie appellant from his own Iudge in other cauſes: If the appellant die, during the time of the Appeale, and leaue no heire behind him, the Appeale ceaſeth, but if he leaue an heir behind him, &amp; the matter of the Appeale concernes none but himſelfe, he is not to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to follow it, for euerie one may renounce his owne ſuite: but if it concerne the Exchequer, or any other bodie, then may hee be compelled to follow it. The Exchequer is the Princes Treaſurie, and the patrimonie of the common wealth, and hath many &amp; ſinguler prerogatiues, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat men haue not. Such as are taken captiue by the enemy, become their ſeruants, who haue taken them, vnleſſe eyther they eſcape home againe themſelues, or be ranſomed by their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16472:21"/>
friendes, in both which caſes they recouer all right and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges they had in their owne common wealth before. By the Law all Subiects whatſoeuer are bound to ſerue the common wealth in warre, inſomuch that if any being preſt withdraw himſelfe, or his child from it, he is to be counted as a rebell, and for his puniſhment is to be baniſhed, and mulcted or fined in the greateſt part of his goods. As the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and rewards of Souldiors were many to incorage them to vertue and manhood; ſo their ſhames and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were great, to feare them from cowardice and vice: But among the reſt of the priuiledges of Souldiors, the old Souldiors were the greateſt. Of Subiects, ſome dwelt in Shires, and liued after their owne Lawes, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe were made partakers of the honors of the Citie: ſome other were inhabitants onely in the common wealth, and had onely a houſe in the ſame place to dwell in, and had no right to beare office: ſome other were ſtraungers brought in, which were ruled by the Law of them among whom they dwelt. Amongſt thoſe that dwelt in Shires, the chiefeſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate was he whom they called <hi>Decurio,</hi> who was not ſent by the people of Rome thither (for he was a Magiſtrate of Magiſtrates) but elected by the people there; and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was, to kéepe the treaſurie of the Countrey, to prouide victuall, exact tribute, and gouerne the ſtate there, in maner as our Shirifes doe here: His office was onely <hi>annuall,</hi> leaſt by libertie, and luſt of gouernment and continuance thereof it might grow into a tyrannie. Such as are Subiects, are to ſerue the common wealth in ſuch offices, places, and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as their abilitie is fit for, and the neceſſitie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth requires. The ſeruices of the Common wealth were of thrée ſorts; Patrimoniall, ſuch as belong to euery mans patrimony to performe, which ſtood chiefly vpon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and charges, which were to go out of euery mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance towards the performance of ſuch burthen as lay vpon him by law, cuſtome, or commaund of him that had power thereto: Perſonall, which were to be performed by the care and induſtrie of the partie and his corporall labour,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16472:22"/>
without expence of his purſe. Mixt, which required both care of the mind, and labour of the bodie, and expence of the purſe, and are impoſed aſwell in conſideration of the thing, as the perſon, which euery ſubiect is to vndergo, vnleſſe by the Law, or by the indulgence of the Prince they are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; as ſome are excuſed by reaſon of olde age, ſome by yong age, ſome for their dignitie, ſome for their calling, ſome for their ſtate of bodie, ſome for that they ſerue in the neceſſarie ſeruices of the Common wealth at home, or abrode, as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors doe, ſome for that they are neceſſary places of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices for Gods Religion, as cathedrall Churches, &amp; other Churches are, ſome for that they are good and neceſſarie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Seminaries for the Common wealth, for learning and ſuch other imployments, as Colledges, Societies, and Schooles of learnings and nurture are. Legates and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors had immunitie from all publike ſeruices, not only the time of their embaſſage, but alſo two yeare after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; They were called Legates, in that they were choſen as fit men, out of many; their perſon was ſacred both at home and abrode, ſo that no man might lay violent hands on them without breach of the Law of Nations. Such as are Magiſtrats of cities ought ſo to gouerne, that no negligence may be iuſtly imputed vnto them, otherwiſe they are to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it, and that when their office is expyred, they giue vp a iuſt accompt, both of what they haue receiued, &amp; what they haue laied out, &amp; pay in the reſidue, if there be any. Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Cities, together with the conſent of the Burgeſſes therof, may ſet downe ſuch orders and decrées, as are for the benefit &amp; well ordering thereof, which are to be obſerued of all thoſe which are Inhabitants therof, and being once wel and duely ſet downe, are not to be reuerſed, but to the good of the Citie or Comminalty. New publike works, ſuch as are good for the Common weale euery one may make without the leaue of the Prince, vnleſſe it be done for emulation, or cauſe of diſcord; but for old works, in which ſtands the ſecuritie of the Common wealth, as Caſtles, towers, gates, and wals of Cities, nothing is to be done or innouated in them without
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16472:22"/>
the Princes warrant, neyther is it lawfull for any man to graue his name in any publike work, vnles it be his at whoſe coſt the work is done. Faires are authorized by Princes only &amp; are inuented for trade of marchandize, &amp; vttering of wares, which Countrymen haue cauſe to buy, or ſell: and haue their priuileges, that no man in any Faire can be arreſted for any priuat debt; they are called <hi>Nundinae</hi> therupon, that euery ninth day they were holden, either in one place or other: He that for x. yeares ſpace intermitteth to vſe his Fayre, loſeth the priuiledge therof. If any make any promiſe to a Citie or Common wealth to do any thing vpon certain cauſe, as that he might be made Conſul, or that he would repaire ſome part of the Citie that was burnt, he ſhall by the Law be compelled to performe his promiſe: for it is not meet that ſuch promiſes ſhould be ſatiſfied with repentance. Such as profeſſe liberall Sciences in any Common wealth, whereby youth is inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; brought vp to knowledge, or be Scholmaſters, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Phiſick, or be Midwiues, Notaries, Auditors, or Caſters of accompts, or Regiſters, the Law alloweth not only a competent ſtipend in recompence of their ſkil &amp; paines, but alſo affordes them meanes how the ſame may be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if it be denied. But as for Philoſophers &amp; Lawyers, the Law hath appointed them no ſtipend, not becauſe they are not reuerend Sciences, &amp; worthy of reward or ſtipend, but becauſe either of them are moſt honorable profeſſions, whoſe worthines is not to be valued or diſhonored by money: yet in theſe caſes many things are honeſtly taken, which are not honeſtly aſked; and the Iudge may according to the qualitie of the cauſe, and the ſkill of the Aduocate, the cuſtome of the Court, and the worth of the matter that is in hand, appoint them a fée anſwerable to their place, as alſo to ſuch as are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters betwéene parties in matters of traffique, when one vnderſtands not an others language.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Tome of the Law is the Code, &amp; ſtands in xij. Bookes, whereof eight for the Titles follow in a maner the order of the Digeſt, a few titles only excepted, which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beſides thoſe of the Digeſt, but as for the 4. other, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16472:23"/>
are the firſt, the tenth, the 11. &amp; the 12. although the ſubiect they treat of be named in the Digeſt, yet the things which are there named are not handled in the Digeſt, and therefore will I paſſe ouer thoſe 8. other, leſt happily I might ſéeme to do one thing twice, &amp; therefore will I refer the Reader ouer to that which hath bin ſaid of them before in the handling of the Digeſt; for they are almoſt twinnes of one mother, ſo that whoſoeuer knowes the one, ſhall with no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſcerne the other, &amp; come to the other fower, yet not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there: But yet before I lay open the matter therof, I wil in a word or two ſhew why this volume of the Law is called the Code, who is the author thereof, &amp; out of whom it was collected, what moued the author after ſo many learned titles ſet downe before, of ſuch things as are in the Digeſt deduced, by ſuch a number of worthy Lawiers (as the lawes of the Digeſt themſelues doe by their inſcriptions ſhew, for euery law carrieth with him in his forehead the name of his Author) to make a new floriſh of the ſame, &amp; what the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Code odth confer vnto a Student or practiſer of the Law more than the knowledge of the Digeſt doth.</p>
            <p>The Code therefore is named of the word <hi>Caudex,</hi> that is the trunck or timber of the trée from which the barke of the trée is pild or puld off, of which men aunciently vſed to make writing tables, artificially binding them vp into the forme of a booke, and vſing them for bookes, before the vſe of paper or parchment was knowen, inſomuch as many of theſe tables being bound together, they were called a Code, or booke: beſides whereas the auncient Lawyers before <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinianus</hi> time, vſed to write their pleas and anſweres in ſcroules of paper or parchment, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> himſelfe firſt put them in a booke, and therefore termed them by the name of a Code.</p>
            <p>The Code it ſelfe is compiled of the anſweres of 56. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and their wiſe Councell, whereof ſundry were lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; ſkilfull Lawyers, as the ſtorie of that time doth ſhew, and the Lawes themſelues do name ſome of them, as that moſt excellent and famous man <hi>Papinian,</hi> and ſome others;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16472:23"/>
that is from the dayes of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor, vnto the age of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The cauſe that moued <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> hereto was, that in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt he found not euery caſe decided that fals out in common vſe of life (for how is it poſſible when as euery moment there fals out new matter, for which former Lawes made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion?) and therefore thought good to ſupplie that by new Lawes, which he found defectiue in the old: ſo that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of thoſe titles grew not, that the Emperor had any meaning to fill the world with multitude of Lawes, for he had found the inconuenience thereof already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had repealed and aboliſhed ſo many thouſand of olde Lawes, as he had; but it came rather of that, that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of cauſes were ſo many, that euery day there fell out ſome vnexpected thing that was neuer heard of before: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide notwithſtanding the carefulneſſe of the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his great Lawyer <hi>Treboman,</hi> and others, whom he vſed for the ſelecting &amp; choſing out of the pureſt, beſt, and moſt agréeing Lawes among themſelues, out of that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted heap of Lawes, he then aboliſhed; yet they were not ſo quicke ſighted, but in that great worke ſundry antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or contrarie Lawes paſt them, which had néed to be expounded and amended, and the Authors to be recited. Further ſundry of ancient Lawes were ſo ſubtlely written, that there was more wit then profit in them, ſo that it was expedient the Emperor ſhould explane the ſame, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all ſubtlety a ſide, giue a right ſence vnto the Law. Laſtly whereas many things were deliuered by them brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and therefore obſcurely, the Law-giuer in his princely wiſdome, ſet out the ſame in other Lawes more plentifull and diſtinctly, all which were the chiefeſt cauſes why the Emperor ſet out the booke of the Code.</p>
            <p>The Code neither in ſtyle neither in methode commeth to the perfection of the Digeſt, as that which for the ſtyle is a barbarous Thracian phraſe Latinized, ſuch as neuer any meane Latiniſt ſpake, whereas notwithſtanding the ſtyle of the Digeſt is verie graue and pure, &amp; ſuch as doth not much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16472:24"/>
differ from the eloquenteſt ſpéech that euer the Romanes vſed, and for the Methode, it hath no particuler diſpoſition, other then ſuch as is borowed of the Digeſt it ſelfe, &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is rude and vnſkilfull, where it doth recéede from the ſame: yet doth it not lack his good vſe, for to ſuch as follow the practiſe of the law, the knowledge of the Code is much more expedient then the knowledge of the Digeſt is, for that the lawes of the Code doe determine matter in daily vſe of life; which, when they are like in all ages (for the ſame is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more vpon the ſtage, the perſons a litle altered) it cannot be but the learning thereof is very profitable and expedient for the Common wealth, whereas notwithſtanding the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Digeſt ſtands rather in diſcuſſing of ſubtill que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Law, &amp; enumerations of the variety of opinions of ancient Lawyers thereupon, which haue more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of wit, than benefit toward the common wealth in them; but hereof hetherto.</p>
            <p>The firſt Booke of the Code treateth of Religion, and the Rites &amp; Ceremonies thereto belonging, whereof I ſaid there was no ſpecial Tractat in the Digeſt, ſauing that it deuideth the publike right into that which concernes the Church, and Church men, &amp; the Magiſtrates of the Common wealth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the latter branch thereof only, &amp; omitting the firſt, becauſe out of that heatheniſh Religion which was vſed in thoſe ancient Lawyers daies, and thoſe ſuperſticious Rites, whereof their Bookes were full, nothing could be taken that might ſerue for our Religion: wherupon he inſtituted a new diſcourſe thereof in the Code, beginning firſt with the bleſſed Trinitie, one in eſſence, and thrée in perſon, wherein he ſets downe a briefe ſumme of our Chriſtian faith, agréeable to the doctrine of the Prophets, &amp; Apoſtles, and the fower firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Counſels, the Nicene, Conſtantinopolitan, Epheſine, and Calcedon, forbidding any man publikely to diſpute, or ſtriue thereabout, taking occaſion vpon the Neſtorian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which not long before had ſprung vp, and had mightily infected the Church, which <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> by this confeſſion of Fayth ſo publiſhed to the whole world, and penall Edict
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16472:24"/>
ioyned thereunto, hoped to repreſſe: After he hath ſet downe a full and ſound confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Primitiue Church, next he addeth a title of the holie Church it ſelfe, and of her priuiledges, which either concerne Eccleſiaſticall mens perſons themſelues, or their ſtate, and ſubſtance, or the actions one Eccleſiaſticall man had againſt an other, or with or againſt Lay perſons: where alſo he proſecuteth the degrées of Prieſts, or Miniſters, their offices, orders, and how the ſame are to be come by, (that is without bribes or Simonie, or other worldly reſpect ſaue the worth of the perſon onely) and the rights of holie places. Prieſts are ſo called, becauſe they were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as it were ſeuered from the reſt of the people, and giuen vp to God: which alſo were called Elders, eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo in age, or ought to be in ſuch manners, and carefull cariage of themſelues. Amongeſt Prieſts, or Miniſters, Biſhops haue the firſt place, who are as it were the Ouerſeers and Superintendents of the reſt, ſo called of their watchfulneſſe, care, labour, and faithfulneſſe in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people, and doing other dueties, which they owe vnto the Church. The loweſt degrée of men among the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall hierarchy were the Clarkes, ſo called of their lot by which they were choſen and allotted to Gods ſeruice. To Biſhops Prieſts, and other of that rank, did appertaine the care of Hoſpitals, whereof ſome were for Orphans, ſome for Infants, ſome for Impotent and diſeaſed perſons, ſome for Poore people, ſome for Strangers, &amp; other like miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons, &amp; therefore together with the title of Biſhops &amp; Clarks is ioyned the title of Hoſpitals, or Almes-houſes. In place next after the Biſhops themſelues, comes their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; audience; for albeit the chiefeſt office of a Biſhop is to inſtruct the people in the doctrine of the word, &amp; in good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life: yet foraſmuch as all will not be obedient vnto the word, neither brought by the perſuaſion thereof to good nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; to be kept in order, &amp; the eminency of the degrée, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhops are placed, is not ſufficient to kéepe the people in obedience without ſome power &amp; iuriſdiction, and becauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16472:25"/>
the Church it ſelfe is the mother and maintainer of Iuſtice, therefore there is by the Emperor himſelfe, and his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, as many as profeſſed Chriſtianitie, certaine pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar iuriſdictions Eccleſiaſticall, aſſigned to the Biſhops, more worthy then the Ciuill, ouer perſons and cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, ſuch as touch the Soule and Conſcience, or do appertaine to any charitable or godlie vſes: and ouer the Laitie ſo far forth as eyther the Laitie themſelues haue bin content to ſubmit themſelues vnto their gouernment, that is ſo far, as eyther it concernes their Soules health, or the outward gouernment of the Church in things decent or comly, or that it concernes poore and miſerable perſons, ſuch as widowes, orphans, captiues, and ſuch other like help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe people are, or where the Ciuile Magiſtrates cannot be come by, or doth voluntarily delay iudgement; in all which anciently a Biſhop was to performe double fayth and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, firſt of an vncorrupt Iudge, and then of a holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But in many of theſe matters in theſe dayes, the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will not ſuffer themſelues to be controld, and therefore hath taken away moſt of theſe dealings from them, yea, euen in charitable cauſes. Immediatly followeth a title of Heretickes, Maniches, Samaritans, Anabaptiſts, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtataes, abuſers of the Croſſe of Chriſt, Iewes, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the hoaſt of heauen, Pagans, and of theyr Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Sacrifices; whom the Biſhop is not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute by learning, but alſo to ſuppreſſe by authoritie, for he hath not the Spirituall ſword in vaine. The Heretickes, Iewes, and Pagans ſhall not haue Chriſtian men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be their ſeruants: that ſuch as flie to the Church for Sanctuarie, or claime the ayde thereof, ſhall not be drawen from thence, vnleſſe the offence be haynous, and done of a pretenſed and purpoſed malice, in which caſe no Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to be allowed them, but wicked people are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to their deſert, agréeable to the word of God it ſelfe, which would not haue his Altar be a refuge vnto the wicked: And ſo far of that part of publike right, which appertayneth to the Prieſtes, or Miniſters, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16472:25"/>
their Function, which was omitted in the Digeſt, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in the Code. Now it followeth, that wyth like breuitie I run ouer the thrée laſt Bookes of the Code, which themſelues were rather ſhadowed in the Digeſt, in the title of the right of the Exchequer, then in any iuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion handled.</p>
            <p>The firſt therefore of them ſetteth out, what is the right of the Exchequer, and in what things it ſtandeth, as in goods excheted, becauſe there is no Heire vnto them, or that they are forfeyted by any offence wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie death, or otherwiſe. How ſuch as are in debt to the Exchequer, and their ſuerties are to be ſued. Of the right of thoſe things which the Exchequer ſels by outcry, where he that offereth moſt carrieth it away, and how the ſame may be reuoked, vnleſſe all rights and ceremonies bee ſolemnly performed therein. How things that are in Common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen the Exchequer and priuat men, may be ſold, and that the Exchequer euict nothing that it hath once ſold, for that, it were a thing againſt the dignitie of the Exchequer, &amp; would terrifie priuat men for bargaining with it. Of thoſe that haue borrowed money out of the publicke receipts, and what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie they incurre, if they repay it not at their daies coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, ſometimes the forfaiture of foure double of that they haue borrowed, ſometimes danger of life it ſelfe. That in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of penalties, the Exchequer be not preferred before ſuch as the Offender was truely indebted vnto, but that they be firſt ſerued, and then the Exchequer haue onely that which is left. What vſurie the Exchequer may take, that is for money lent, and not for ſuch ſums as grow out of Mulcts and Penalties. That ſuch ſentences that are giuen againſt the Exchequer, may be retracted within thrée yeare follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although ordinarily all other Sentences are irreuocable after ten daies; neither can be reformed after that time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reſcript of the Prince, or by pretence of new proofe. Of the goods of ſuch as exchet by reaſon they haue made no Will, and of the goods of Incorporations, that is, of ſuch as dye without Heires, that they come not to the common
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16472:26"/>
banke of the citie, but that they exchet vnto the Prince: Of Promotors, by whoſe information any goods are confiſcate, either by reaſon of the goods themſelues, as that they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterine, or that they are prohibited to be exported or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or vpon ſome other like cauſe, or by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that haue offended, and crimes wherein they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and their puniſhment, if they giue in any wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or other then ſuch as they are bound vnto, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office: and that they giue no information in, but by aduiſe of the Attorney of the Exchequer, and that they make no information againſt their Lord and Maſter, but in caſe of Treaſon: that it ſhall be lawfull for no man to make ſuite vnto the Prince for thoſe things that are confiſcated vnto the Exchequer, as though it were more Honorable for the Prince to beſtow ſuch things on his Courtiers, then to kéepe them to himſelfe: and therefore, ſuch as are the Princes Secretaries, his Maſters of Requeſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are of his remembrance, are forbidden to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acts, Inſtruments, or other writings hereof, vnleſſe the Prince of his owne motion, and at no other mans ſuite, will or commaund the ſame: Of ſuch as put themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exchequer, vpon any confeſſion made againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: Of ſuch to whom the Prince ioyntly hath giuen any farme or like thing, that where one of them dyeth without an heire, the other may ſuccéed him: Of Treaſure found, that the Exchequer be made acquainted with it; and that if it bee found in a publicke place, halfe goeth to the Exchequer, the other to the finder: but if it bee in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat place, then halfe to the Lord of the ſoyle, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Finder: Of prouiſion for Corne and ſuch other like: Of Tribute, which was an ordinarie payment: Of impoſition and ſuper-impoſitions, which were paiments laid vpon the ſubiect aboue ordinarie tax, for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſitie, to which charges the ordinarie tax doth not ſuffice; which was not to bee done, but vpon great and vrgent cauſe, by a councell called together, and with the conſent of the ſubiect: Of Collectors of the Subſidie, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16472:26"/>
in what manner they are to bee collected and brought into the Exchequer, and of the puniſhment of thoſe that in the collection thereof extort more than is due: that it ſhall bee lawfull to diſtraine for Tribute vnpaid: that ſuch acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances as the Exchequer ſhall deliuer vnto the accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſhall bee their full and finall diſcharge: and that the Subſidie Bookes ſhall euery quarter bee ſent vp into the Exchequer, with the account of the Collectors, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may appeare how much euery man hath paid or ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the Exchequer: and that nothing may bée doone for the grieuance of the poore, or the fauour of the rich: Of the booke of accounts of yéerely gifts that commonly Subiects preſent vnto the Prince at New yeares tide and otherwiſe, and that they bee diuided from the accounts of the Exchequer: That no man bee fréed from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tribute: Of ſpending out ſuch ancient graine and other like prouiſion as is laid vp in the common ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and making prouiſion for a new, and compelling the ſubiects, ſuch as haue plentie of ſuch graine, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bee vinoed and muſtie, to buy the ſame, that the whole loſſe thereof may not lye vpon the Exchequer: What penſion ſuch Mannors as the Prince hath giuen or releaſed from payment of Subſidies ſhall giue, and that no man bee ſo hardy to beg ſuch a matter of the Prince leſt the reuenews of the Exchequer be thereby diminiſhed: Of Mannors that haue béene tranſlated from the payment of one kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion to another, or that haue béene in their taxation ouer rated: Of Braſſe that Minerall Countries are to yéeld, or money in lieu thereof: Of Controllers, whoſe Office it was to caſt ouer againe ſuch accompts as were brought into the Exchequer, or to examine them a new, leaſt perhaps, there might bee an errour in them.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning thoſe things which doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the accompt of the Exchequer, or the patrimony thereof, or ſuch penſions or payments as are due vnto the ſame. Now followeth the other part of this tenth Booke,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16472:27"/>
which containeth the burthens, duties, or offices impoſed on the ſubiect by the Exchequer, and what excuſe the ſubiect might alleage in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>Burthens or dueties, were either perſonall, as places of Honour, which were not to be continued from the father to the child; or they be Patrimoniall which are charged vpon mens inheritance, either for the good of the common wealth, or to inrich the Exchequer againſt dangers that are like to inſue: which are vndertooke and performed either by thoſe which are of neceſſitie to obey that which is inioyned them, or by thoſe which offer themſelues voluntarily therto, which ſeldom happeneth in patrimonial charges: but in matters of Honour and Perſonall ſeruices, it many times commeth to paſſe, that men excuſe not themſelues from bearing of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or doing of Perſonall ſeruices, although they haue an immunitie from them, either by the graunt of the Prince, (which is to be vnderſtood of extraordinarie ſeruice only, and not of ordinarie) or by the benefit of the Law; for by the law men are many times vpon iuſt cauſes excuſed from Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeruices, ſo it be not from ſuch ſeruices as no man can excuſe himſelfe from; ſuch as are Poſtings and carriages, when the Prince paſſeth by, or the Tenure of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doe ſo require it, and the erecting and repairing of Bridges, Waies and Wals, the prouiſion and carriage of Corne, and other like kindes neceſſarie for the maintenance of the Princes houſe. Men are excuſed either generally from all kinds of ſeruices, or particularly from ſome: as all Minors, ſpecially ſuch as are Students in any famous V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie, whileſt they giue themſelues there vnto their booke, are excuſed fron all Perſonall ſeruices, but not from Patrimoniall ſeruices; as alſo all old men of the age of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie yeares and vpward, all profeſſors of Liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whereby the common wealth is benefited, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Phiſick, Grammer, Oratorie or Philoſophie, ſo they bee allowed by the Magiſtrate and ſeauen ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men in the profeſſion which they make ſhew of, and bee not <hi>Supernumerarii,</hi> or aboue the number of thoſe

that are to be allowed, in which number are, neither Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets or Auditors: they are alſo excuſed, which vpon iuſt cauſe are diſmiſſed, either out of the Army or out of the Schooles, either for lack of health, or that they are ſo wounded, that they can neither ſerue in war any longer, nor longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſtudy, which are ſo to bee vnderſtood that they yeeld excuſe from Perſonall Seruices onely and not from Prediall.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things that yéeld excuſe in part, from Perſonall ſeruices are theſe; the Renting of the Princes cuſtome, the baſenes of the perſons ſtate, not fit to beare any Office of credit, infamie, baniſhment, an amotion from a mans place and degrée, feminine ſex, which are to vndergoe ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only, as are agréeable to their ſex. Imbaſſages impoſed vpon any by the Prince and his Councell, which hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie alſo of two yeares after their returne, if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage were into places becond the ſea, or into any far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not if it were into any Country néere at hand. Skill in any Manuel Arte or Myſteries, to the intent that they may haue both time to learne their Arts, and ſo become the Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller in the ſame, and alſo haue more alacritie to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Miſterie. That that care be had, that ſuch are choſen to office, that they be of the worthier ſort for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and place, and the richeſt for their ſtate: that no man be choſen to office for enuie, and if any be, and the ſame be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he that did chuſe him thereto is to be fined, and to pay the expences of the ſuite, vnleſſe he which is choſen die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhort time after the choiſe, then his ſucceſſors are not bound thereto. Further, men are excuſed, if being in one Office, they are choſen vnto another, to the intent they may the better execute and performe that office they haue in hand: Such as are remembrancers, which make Bookes of what is due to the Exchequer, and what is brought in, Auditors, Receiuers, Tellers, Granarers, Weighers, ſuch as weigh &amp; try ſuch gold as is brought and paid into the Exchequer; Collectors, that is, ſuch as gather vp the gold that is due in the Prouinces to the Exchequer, and ſend the ſame ouer

            <p>Iuſtices of Peace, which are diſtributed by countries, for the more quiet and peaceable gouernment of the ſame, whoſe care was to ſéeke out théeues and malefactors, and to foreſée that the Country people did make no mutinie, by reaſon of the Taxes and Subſidies that were leuied vpon them: that for gold, there might bee paid ſiluer, and againe, ſiluer for gold into the Exchequer, ſo that the value thereof were made equall.

            <p>The Eleuenth Booke procéedeth in the enumeration of other vocations, that are exempted from perſonall ſeruices of the common wealth, beſides thoſe that haue bin named in the tenth Booke: as maſters of ſhips and Mariners, which ſerued to bring in any Marchandiſe or prouiſion for the Princes houſhold, out of forreine Countries into the Princes ſtorehouſe; yea, although they were priuat mens ſhips, which were imployed to that ſeruice, ſo that if a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat mans ſhip were laden with any publicke prouiſion, there could not any other priuat burthen bee impoſed vpon him: for that, if the ſhip periſh by ſhipwrack by reaſon of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat burthen that is put therein aboue the publicke charge, then hee is to anſwere the loſſe thereof vnto the Exchequer, otherwiſe than in the caſe of priuat men, who are themſelues to beare the loſſe of thoſe things which are exported or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; neither can they make gaine of priuat mens ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke or of thoſe things which are caſt out into the ſea, to eaſe the lading of the ſhip, but are bound to reſtore it

to the owner, vnder paine of confiſcation of their goods by the Temporall Law, and excommunication of their perſons by the Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrate. Adde to this, Miners or Metallers, and the gouernours of the ſame; gatherers of Muſkels and other like ſhell fiſh, with whoſe bloud either Purple is made, or out of which Pearles are taken: which colour Princes onely might vſe, as alſo veluet and cloth of gold, neither was it lawfull for any man (vnder the degrée of the Prince) to weare the ſame, ſauing onely women in ſome ſort, for that ſuch ornaments are fitter for women than men. Ioyne to theſe Monetaries, which ſerued to coyne money, Wainemen or Carmen, which with their owne cattell carried or conueyed things which belonged to the Princes Treaſurie. The like priuiledge had they which made Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the Princes Armorie, as Speares, Breſt plates, Darts, and ſuch like; or made Bridles, Girdles ſtudded with pearle or pretious ſtone vnto the Court, for the Kings houſhold, who onely were allowed to weare the ſame. Such as had the care and gouernment of any Corporations, as the Princes Bakers, Vintners, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſellers, Money-changers, profeſſors of Liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſpecially in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeate of the Empire was tranſlated thither, had all the priuiledges of old <hi>Rome,</hi> ſauing the Eccleſiaſtical prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for which notwithſtanding there was long diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the two cities.</p>
            <p>Next after <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople, Beritus</hi> the chiefe Citie of <hi>Syria,</hi> had great priuiledges, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vniuerſitie which was in the ſame, and ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces or Countries as ſerued the ſame, or any of them with yearely prouiſion of Corne, Oyle, Béefe, Mutton, Porke, and ſuch other like victuall: which prouiſion was to bee diſtributed among the poore and impotent of the Cities, and not to bee giuen to ſtout and valiant beggers, which are able to get their liuing with their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16472:29"/>
owne handes, and therefore were to bee compelled to worke. The Aldermen or Gouernours of Cities, for that they are imployed in matters of greater ſeruices: yet none of them were to be called to any office before he had bin euen with the common wealth, if happily any of them were in debt to it; neither were they or any of them excuſed more than from perſonal ſeruices, but in predial dueties, they paid euery one according to his rate. But as for Enterlud-plaiers and houſes of baudery, they had no exemption at all, but paid double charges to the reſt. Of Huſbandmen, ſome are ſeruants, as Copiholders, others are frée, as Fréeholders, which notwithſtanding themſelues are, as it were, bound vnto the ſoyle, and are rated in the Subſidie according to their Acres, and if they haue no Land, then according to the head or number of their houſhold; which notwithſtanding, at this day is taken away, and theſe, as well pay rent to the owners of the ground (wherein notwithſtanding, the Land-lord cannot exact of them, or charge them aboue that which hath bin couenanted betwéene them) as Tribute, and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluer to the common wealth: for the declining of which, and auoiding of neceſſarie ſeruices of the common wealth, as no man can put himſelfe vnder the patronage of any Noble man, ſo alſo they cannot bee called from this ſeruice of the common wealth, to any other. Country men, ſuch as were addicted to the ground they tilled, although the ground were their owne, yet could they not ſell it to any man, but to him that was of the mother village wherein himſelfe was. A Mother village, was that whence all the villages round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout were deriued. Although all ſuch huſbandmen as dwell in any village, are to pay Subſidie for ſuch goods as they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, or ſuch Lands as they hold; yet one neighbour is not to be diſquieted or arreſted for another mans due: for that it is a thing vnlawfull to trouble one for another, or not to ceſſe men indifferently, according to the value of their Lands, and the worth of their goods. And therefore the Romanes in rating of matters of taxes, had firſt Ceſſers which rated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16472:29"/>
men according to that which they thought their ſtate to be: then had they Leuellers or Surueyors, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the rate ſet downe, mended it, and made it euen, eaſing ſuch perſons or grounds as were ouer-rated, and charging more déeply ſuch others as were ouerlightly taxed, procuring ſuch grounds as were waſt and barren, ſhould be brought to tyllage, and that the barren ſhould be ioyned with the fruitfull, that by ſuch meanes the Prince might receiue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy out of both: March grounds &amp; ſuch as lie in the bounds of any kingdome, ſerue for the maintenance of ſuch garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are there placed for the defence of the Marches, and ſuch as hold the ſaid lands, are to pay an yéerely prouiſion or penſion for the ſame; as alſo the Princes paſtures, woodes, and forreſts, which are let out vpon a certaine yéerely rent, eyther for a certaine time, or in fée farme for euer, which in reſpect they pay an ordinary payment to the Prince, eyther in money, or in prouiſion, are diſcharged from all other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary &amp; extraordinary burthens. Publike things are thoſe which appertaine to the Exchequer, or to the Church, which may in like ſort be rented out for a ſeaſon, or for euer, as the poſſeſſion of the Exchequer may, ſo it be done to the certaine benefit of the Church, and vnder ſuch ſolemnities, as in this caſe are required, otherwiſe it cannot be let out but for 30. yeares, or for thrée liues. Fée farme is when lands and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or other hereditaments, are let out for euer vnder a certaine yearely rent, in reknowledgement of the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, belonging ſtill to the firſt Lord whereby both the right and poſſeſſion paſſeth to the farmer in fée.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt of theſe Bookes, treateth of the honors that the Exchequer giueth; of which the firſt and chiefeſt was the Pretorſhip, which anciently was a great dignitie, but after became an idle name only, &amp; a burthen to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, as in which at their owne charges they were to ſet out playes and ſhewes, and gaue vnto the Emperor in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his or their glebe land, a certaine quantitie of gold called <hi>Aurum glebale,</hi> or if they had no glebe land, then offered they to the Emperor an other péece of gold, called

Next was the Conſulſhip, which was not to be ſought by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by ſcatering money among the people, but by cléere ſuffrages and deſert: After the Conſulſhip came in place the Conſtable, or Maſter of the Soldiors, and thoſe which were called <hi>Patricij,</hi> for that their fathers had bin Senators, whoſe place vnder <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was equall to the Conſuls, although they were in no office and function of the Common wealth; &amp; the other is not ſo much an adminiſtration as a dignitie, as the Senatorſhip aunciently was, into the which who that were admitted, were accompted as Parents to the Prince, and Fathers to their Countrey: Fourthly in place, were the Princes Chamberlaines, who were adorned with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry priuiledges, and had the title of honor: Fiftly, followed the Treaſurer, who was Maſter of all the receits and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prince, publike or priuat, &amp; of all ſuch officers as were vnderneath him: Then the Prenotarie, chiefe notarie or ſcribe of the Court, who for that he had the preheminence, aboue all the Gentlemen of the papers, whom we now call Secretaries, was called <hi>Primicerius,</hi> of the Gréek word <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

After him that was firſt ſecretary, there was an other called ſecond Secretary, and ſo after other Clerks of the Counſell, who were not all in one degree, but ſome were firſt, ſome were ſecond, and ſo in order as their perſon, place, and time did require: Ouer which was the Maſter of the Rols, who now is called Chauncellor, and ſuch as are of the Princes priuie Counſell, or aſſeſſors of his priuie conſiſtory, wherin he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ambaſſages, and debateth of the greateſt affaires of the ſtate, and other waightie matters. The Preſident or Tribune of the Scholes, where young men were trayned vp to feates of armes. The Martials or Preſidents of Militarie affaires: the Phiſitions of the Princes bodie, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> in olde time honored with the title of Earles, as he did the reſt of his chiefe officers, but now they are without the dignitie of that title: The Earles of the Countries who

            <p>Of ſuch as were attendants about the Prince, and were imploied in his ſeruice, the chiefeſt of all were the Senators, and therefore are called in the Law, the Companions of the Prince, and haue all the priuiledges that Souldiors haue: The ſecond order was of them that were Knight riders, which eyther did, or might ſerue in warre: In the third rank were ſuch as were in dignitie.

            <p>The Authentikes therefore are a volume of new Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, ſet out by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperor, after the Code, and brought into the bodie of the Law vnder one Booke.</p>
            <p>In the Authentikes, is not that order obſerued in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Lawes, is eyther in the Digeſt, or the Code, but as occaſion was offered of any doubt, wherein the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſolution was neceſſarie to euery thing, ſo it is ſet downe without any other Methode or forme.</p>
            <p>The whole Volume is deuided into 9. Collations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or Sections, and they againe into 168. Nouels, which alſo are diſtributed into certaine Chapters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:16472:32"/>
They were called Nouels, becauſe they were new Lawes, compared to the Lawes of the Digeſt, or the Code.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Conſtitutions, ſome were generall, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all, who had like cauſe of doubt; ſome other were priuat, and did concerne only the place or perſons, they were writ for, which I will ouerpaſſe with ſilence.</p>
            <p>Of the generall, the firſt title and firſt Nouell of the firſt collation is, that Heires, Feoffées, executors, adminiſtrators, and their ſucceſſors, ſhall fulfill the will of the deceaſed, and within one yeare after his deceaſe, ſhall pay his Legacies and bequeſts: and if they be once ſued for it, they ſhall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with pay that which is due vpon the Will (deducting only a fourth part, which is due vnto the heire by the Law <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia)</hi> or elſe to loſe ſuch bequeſtes as themſelues haue in the Will.</p>

And that a man in like ſort ſuruyuing his wife, ſhall doe the like toward his firſt wiues children, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch Dowry as the firſt wife brought to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>Of Suerties and Warranties, that the Creditors ſhall firſt ſue their Debtors, and take erecution againſt their goods, and finding them not payable, ſhall then take their remedie againſt the Suerties.</p>
            <p>Of Monkes, that they buyld no Monaſteries, but with the leaue of the Biſhop, who is there with prayer to lay the firſt ſtone: And that the Biſhop ſhall appoint ſuch an Abbot ouer the Monkes, as in vertue, and in merit excels the reſt: And beſides of their habit, conuerſation, profeſſions, and change of life, and who is to ſuccéed them in their goods and

            <p>Of Biſhops and Clerks, that is, that Byſhops and Clerks be of good fame, of competent learning, and age, and that they be ordeyned and promoted without Symonie, or briberie, or the iniurie of the preſent Incumbent: And that there bée a ſet number of Clerkes in euery Church, leaſt the Church and Pariſhioners thereby be ouer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Collation treateth of the Churches ſtate, that the lands of the Church be neyther ſold, aliened, nor changed away, but vpon neceſſitie, or that they be let to farme for a time, or vpon other iuſt cauſe, no not with the Prince himſelfe, vnleſſe the change be as good, or better, than that which he receyueth from the Church: and if any man preſume contrarie to this forme, to change with the Church, hée ſhall looſe both the thing hee changed, and the thing he would haue changed for it, and both of them ſhall remayne in the right of the Church: And that no man gyue or change a barren peece of the ground with the Church.</p>
            <p>That Iudges and Rulers of Prouinces be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gifts: of their office, power, authoritie, and ſtipend, and that they ſweare, they ſhall ſo ſincerly and vprightly execute their office, as knowing they ſhall giue an accompt thereof to God and the King: which oath they ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo before the Biſhop of the place, and the chiefe men of that Prouince, whether they are ſent to be Iudges or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors.</p>
            <p>Of the Maſters of Requeſts, and their office, which offer to the Prince ſuters Petitions, and report them back from the Prince vnto the Iudges.</p>
            <p>Of wicked and inceſtuous Marriages, and that ſuch as marrie within thoſe degrees, forfeit all that they haue vnto the Exchequer, for that when they might make lawfull Marriages, they rather chooſe to make vnlawfull Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</p>
            <p>The third Collation contayneth matter againſt Bawdes,

that they be not ſuffered in any place of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that being once warned to forbeare their wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if they offend therein againe, they die the death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If any man let any houſe to a bawd, knowing him to be a bawd, that he ſhall for fait x. li. to the Prince, and his houſe ſhall be in danger to be confiſcated.</p>
            <p>Of Maiors and Gouernors of Cities, that ſuch be choſen that be honeſt people, and men of credit, and that no man of the Citie being thereto choſen, refuſe the ſame, and that ſuch as are therto choſen, ſhall ſwears they will procéed in euery matter, according to Law and conſcience.</p>

            <p>Theſe, and ſundry matters of great importance, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the well gouerning of a Common wealth, are conteyned in the Authenticks, which I paſſe ouer with drie foote, not becauſe they are not neceſſarie to bée knowen, but becauſe I would not cloy the Reader euen with thoſe things which are good.</p>
            <p>All theſe workes are the labour of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> as either ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by him out of auncient Lawyers bookes, and ſuch Emperors decrées, as went before him, or elſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed &amp; ordeyned by himſelfe, as matter &amp; occaſion offered it ſelfe, &amp; the yongeſt of them is néere eleuen hundred yeares of age, that is within 500. yeres after Chriſt, or not much otherwiſe.</p>

            <p>This péece of the Law, although it was not much in vſe in the old Emperors dayes, yet <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> himſelfe ſéemeth to acknowledge them in his Nouell conſtitutions, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>From whence ſoeuer it deſcended, this is certaine, that it came verie late to be a particuler volume of the Law it ſelfe.

Beſide, Fealtie, which ſome call <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium,</hi> by the Feudiſts is tearmed Homage: for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Feude is this, that it draweth with it fayth and homage: ſo that ſuch as are feudataries, or fee men, profeſſe themſelues to owe fayth to ſuch to whom they are in fée, and that they are his men; inſomuch as when a fée man dyeth, his Heyre doth make fayth, and doth his homage to the Lord, as is well ſéene both in the Lord Spirituall and Temporall of this land, who both in their creation, and alſo in theyr ſucceſſion one after an other ſweare an oath, &amp; doe their homage to their Soueraigne, and doe pay other dueties which are ſimbols and ſignes of their ſubiection to their ſoueraigne: And for others that are vnder the degrée of Barons, and yet are fée men vnto the King, and ſo do
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16472:40"/>
not manuell obedience vnto his Maieſtie, they pay yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſomething in reſpect of theyr homage, according to the quantitie or qualitie of the fée or tenure they hold of the Prince.</p>
            <p>A Feude in Engliſh may be called a tenure, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Littleton</hi> when he treated of Feudes, ſo far forth as they are here in vſe in England (Such as are all thoſe which are called in Latin <hi>Feuda militaria, &amp; Feuda ſcutiferorum,</hi> called by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are by the Lawes of the land, tearmed by the named of knights ſeruices, and Eſcuage,) to call them by the names of Tenures.</p>
            <p>A Feude is a grant of lands, honors, or fées, made either to a man at the will of the Lord, or Soueraigne, or for the Feudataries owne life, or to him, or his heires for euer, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condition, that he and his heires in caſe where the feude is perpetuall, doe acknowledge the gyuer and his heyres to be their Lord and Soueraigne, and ſhall beare faith and alleageance vnto him, and his, for the ſaid Tenure, and ſhall doe ſuch ſeruice to him and his for the ſame, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them couenanted, or is proper to the nature of the feude.</p>
            <p>Of Feudes, ſome are Temporall, ſome other are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.</p>
            <p>Temporall feudes are thoſe that are gyuen, eyther for terme of a mans life, or for yeares, or at the will of the Lord, for ſome ſeruice done, or to be done; ſuch as are Annuities giuen to Lawyers for counſell, Penſions giuen to Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their aduiſe, Stipends to any Teacher of artes and ſciences, Fées for kéeping of Towers or Caſtles, called by Feudiſts <hi>Caſtalia,</hi> and is by <hi>Littleton</hi> called Caſtle ward, although by him it is taken for a ſtate of inheritance.</p>
            <p>Perpetuall Feudes are rights which men haue by grant from the Soueraigne, or chiefe Lord of the ſoyle or terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, to haue, hold, vſe, occupie, and inioy honors, manors, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to him and his heires for euer, vpon condition that the ſaid vaſſall or partie, his heytes and ſucceſſors, doe homage and fealtie to his Lord,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16472:41"/>
his heires and ſucceſſors, for ſuch honors, landes, or heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments, and doe him eyther ſeruice in warre, according as it is couenanted betwéene the Lord and his vaſſall, or ſuch other ſeruice as the nature of his tenure doth require, or if he fayle therein, ſhall either find ſome other in his roome to do the ſame, or elſe pay a certaine ſumme of money in liew thereof.</p>
            <p>Although this Tenure by the firſt creation thereof be perpetuall, yet that the ſoueraignty thereof ſhould not ſtill remaine vnprofitable to the firſt Lord, the whole benefyt thereof going continually to the vaſſall or tenant; it is proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Soueraigne or chiefe Lord the firſt yeare, the heyre or Succeſſor of the vaſſall comes vnto his land, ſhall haue the whole reuenue of his liuelihood for that yeare, or a certeine ſumme of money in token of the retorne thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and the redemption thereof made againe by the tenant, which by the Law of the Nouels is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; is well nigh the ſame that we call liuery, which euery heire that holdeth in Knights ſeruice, ſueth out before he take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his land, as heire to his anceſters.</p>
            <p>This Tenure is got eyther by Inueſtiture or by Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Inueſtiture is the ſame that we call Creation, and is the primier grant of a feude or tenure to any, with al rights and ſolemnities thereto belonging, wherein the homager, or feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datarie for the moſt part vpon his knées promiſeth faith and allegeance vnder a ſolemne oath vnto his Lord, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
            <p>Succeſſion is whereby the eldeſt ſonne ſuccéedeth, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his inheritance, and if he faile and haue no iſſue, then the next brother, and ſo in order ſucceſſiuely, and if there be no ſonne, then the next heire male, and if their bée no heyre male, then the land eſcheats vnto the Lord. For the Lumbards, from whom the feudes firſt came, or at the leaſt were chiefly deriued from them, directing all their policie as the Lacedemons did, to matters of warre, had no ſeminine feudes among them, but after by proceſſe of time, there were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16472:41"/>
created aſwell Feminine feuds as Maſculine feuds, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as where there was no iſſue male to put them from it, women did ſuccéed in the inheritance.</p>
            <p>Of Feuds, ſome are regall, ſome not regall: Regall are thoſe which are giuen by the prince only, neither doe belong to any inferior to giue.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, ſome are Eccleſiaſticall, as Archbiſhopricks, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks and ſuch like: Others are Ciuile or Temporall, as Dukedomes, Earledomes, Vicounts, and Lords, who by that are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the people, that they haue the conducting of the Princes Armie at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, if they be thereto appointed, and haue right of Peeres in making of Lawes, in matters of triall, and ſuch other like buſineſſes.</p>
            <p>Not Regall are thoſe which hold not immediatly of the Prince, but are holden of ſuch Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuile States which haue had their Honours immediatly from the Prince.</p>
            <p>Beſides of Feuds, ſome are Liege, others not Liege; Liege Feuds, are they in the which the vaſſall or feodatorie promiſeth abſolute fealtie or faith to his Lord, againſt all men without exception of the King himſelfe, or any other more auncient Lord to whom beſids he oweth alleagance or ſeruice. Of this ſort there is none in this Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but ſuch as are made to the King himſelfe, as appeareth by <hi>Littleton</hi> in the title of Homage, wherein is ſpecially excepted the faith which the Homager oweth to his Lord the King.</p>
            <p>Feuds not Liege, are ſuch wherin Homage is done, with ſpeciall reſeruation of his faith and alleageance to the prince and Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch as are Vaſſals or Liege men, ſome are called <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſores maiores;</hi> others <hi>Valuaſores minores. Valuaſores maiores</hi> are ſuch as hold great places of the State vnder the Emperour or King, as are the degrées of Honour before named, and are called Péeres of the Land, which only giues Nobilitie. <hi>Valuaſores minores,</hi> are thoſe which are no Péers
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16472:42"/>
of the Land, and yet haue a preheminence aboue the people, and are, as it were, in a middle Region betwéene the people and the Nobilitie, ſuch as are Knights, Squires, and Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>The Feuds are loſt by ſundry waies, by default of iſſue of him to whom it was firſt giuen, which they call <hi>Apertura feodi;</hi> by ſurrender therof, which by them is termed <hi>Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio feodi;</hi> by forfaiture, and that was in two ſorts, either by not doing the ſeruice that his tenure did require, or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſome villenous act againſt his Lord, as in conſpiring his Soueraignes death, defiling his bed, or deflowring his daughter, or ſome other like act treacherous to his Lord, and vnworthy of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And ſo much of the Ciuile Law, and the Bookes thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pertaining. Now it followeth I doe in like order ſpeake of the Canon Law, which is more hardly thought vpon among the people, for that the ſubiect thereof, in many points, is of many groſſe and ſuperſtitious matters vſed in the time of Papiſtrie, as of the Maſſe, and ſuch other like trumperie; and yet there are in it beſide, many things of great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and euen thoſe matters of ſuperſtition themſelues, being in a generalitie, well applyed to the true ſeruice of God, may haue a good vſe and vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>The Canon Law, hath his name of the Gréeke word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which in Engliſh is a Rule, becauſe it leads a man ſtraight, neither drawes him to the one ſide or the other, but rather correcteth that which is out of Leuill and Lyne.</p>
            <p>The Canon Law conſiſteth partly of certaine Rules, taken out of the holy Scripture, partly of the writings of the auncient fathers of the Church, partly of the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of general &amp; prouincial Councels, partly of the Decrees of Popes of formerages.</p>
            <p>Of the Canon Law, there are two principall parts, the Decrées and the Decretals.</p>
            <p>The Decrées are Eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions, made by the Pope and Cardinals, at no mans ſuite, and are either
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16472:42"/>
Rules taken out of the Scripture, or Sentences out of the auncient Fathers, or Decrées of Councels.</p>
            <p>The Decrees were firſt gathered together by <hi>Ivo,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Carnat,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord God but afterward poliſhed and perfected by <hi>Gratian,</hi> a monke of the order of Saint <hi>Bennets,</hi> in the yeare 1149. and allowed by <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope, whoſe Confeſſor hee was, to bee read in Schooles, and to bee alledged for Law.</p>
            <p>Of all the ſeuerall volumes of the Canon Law, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crées are the auncienteſt, as hauing their beginning from the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the firſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who firſt gaue leaue to the Chriſtians fréely to aſſemble themſelues together, and to make whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes for the well gouernment of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Decrées are diuided into thrée parts, wherof the firſt teacheth of the origen and beginning of the Canon law, and deſcribeth and ſetteth out the rights, dignities, degrées of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons, and the manner of their elections, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and offices, and ſtandeth of one hundred and ten diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part ſetteth out the cauſes, queſtions, and anſweres of this Law, which are in number 36. and are full of great varietie, wiſdom, and delight.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt part, containeth matter of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſacred things, as of Churches, bread and wine in the Sacrament, what daies and Feaſts the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church vſed for the receiuing thereof, of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the Sacraments in Baptiſme, and the vſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, all which is ſet out vnder fiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</p>
            <p>The Decretals are Canonicall Epiſtles, written either by the Pope alone, or by the Pope and Cardinals, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or ſuite of ſome one or more for the ordering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of ſome matter in controuerſie, and haue the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a law in themſelues.</p>
            <p>Of the Decretals there bee thrée volumes, according
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16472:43"/>
to the number of the authors which did deuiſe and publiſh them.</p>
            <p>The firſt volume of the Decretals was gathered together by <hi>Ramundus Barcinius,</hi> Chaplein to <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, at his the ſaid <hi>Gregories</hi> commaundement about the yeare 1231. and publiſhed by him to be read in ſcholes, and vſed for Law in all Eccleſiaſticall Courts.</p>
            <p>The ſext is the worke of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, methoded by him about the yeare 1298. by which, as hee added ſomething to the ordinance of his predeceſſors, ſo hee tooke away many things that were ſuperfluous and contrarie to themſelues, and retained the reſt.</p>
            <p>The third volume of the Decretals, are called the Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, becauſe they were made by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift of that name, and publiſhed by him in the Councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> about the yeare of grace 1308.</p>
            <p>To theſe may be added the Extrauagants of <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij. and ſome other Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe authors are not knowne, and are as Nouell conſtitutions vnto the reſt.</p>
            <p>Euery of theſe former volumes, are diuided into fiue Bookes, and containe, in a manner, one and the ſame titles, whereof the firſt in euery of them, is the title of the bleſſed Trinitie, and of the Catholicke faith, wherein is ſet downe by euery of them a particuler beliefe, diuers in words, but all one in ſubſtance, with the auncient Symbols, or beliefe of the old Orthodox, or Catholicke Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there commeth in place the treatie of Reſcripts, Conſtitutions and Cuſtomes, and the authoritie of them, and when they are to be taken for Law: after followeth the meanes whereby the greater gouernours of the Church, as namely, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and ſuch like come vnto their roome, which was in two ſorts, according as the parties place or degrée was when he was called vnto the roome, as if he were vnder the degrée of a Biſhop, and was called to bee Biſhop, or being a Biſhop, was called to be an Archbiſhop, or to be the Pope himſelfe, he was thereto to bee elected by the Deane and Chapiter of the Church where he was to bee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16472:43"/>
Biſhop, or by the Colledge of the Cardinals in the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but if he were alreadie a Biſhop or an Archbiſhop, and were to be preferred vnto any other Biſhopricke or Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, then was he to be required by the church, he was deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the one ſide or other wilfully or deceiptfully decline Iudgement, the Iudge is to put the other in poſſeſſion of that which is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, or at the leſt, to ſequeſter the fruits and poſſeſſions of that which is in controuerſie; but if both parties appeare and ioyne iſſue affirmatiuely, then is it but a queſtion of Law, and not a fact, neither doth there remaine ought els to bee done by the Iudge, but that hee giue ſentence againſt him that hath confeſſed it, and put his ſentence in execucion. But if iſſue be ioyned negatiuely, then is the plaintife to proue his Libell, ſo far as it conſiſts in fact, by witneſſes which are to be compelled by Law if they will not come, or appeare vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, by publicke and priuat inſtruments, by preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by coniectures, by oath; which being done, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in like ſort is to bee admitted to proue his exceptions, and cleere his preſcription if hee bee able to alledge any, in which hee is Plaintife, neither is hee bound thereto, before the Plaintife haue perfected and prooued his owne right.</p>
            <p>After proofes are brought on either ſide, and the ſame tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly diſputed on by the Aduocats, the Iudge is to giue ſentence, which he is to frame according to the Libell and proofes formerly deduced in the cauſe.

            <p>Prebends and dignities are preferments for Clerkes, but not for ſuch as are idle or abſent from the ſame without iuſt cauſe: but if any Clerk or Miniſter be ſicke, and his diſeaſe be curable he is to receiue the benefit of his prebend or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his abſence, as though he were preſent; but if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, or vncurable, then is he to be put from the exerciſe of his office, and a helper or coadiutor to be ioyned vnto him, and they both to be mayntained of his ſtipend.</p>

            <p>For Contracts in Marine cauſes, ſome are contracts in déed, ſome are as it were contracts: Contracts in déed are all bargaines and ſales whatſoeuer made betwéene Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and Marchant for any commoditie, fraught, or traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in the ſhip, or any ſale or bargaine made of the Ship, or any thing thereto belonging, as Maſtes, cordage, ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, victuals, or any other thing of like nature, neceſſarie for the imployment of the ſhip.</p>

Thoſe things which are as it were contracts, are thoſe perpetuall rights, which are betwéene the Purſer or Maſter of the Ship, and the Paſſengers, or betwéene one paſſenger and an other.</p>
            <p>The perpetuall right which is betwéene the Purſer or Maſter of the ſhip, and the Paſſengers is, that the Purſer or Maſter be anſwerable for all ſuch wares or goods as are brought into the ſhip, whether it be deliuered to himſelfe, or any of his Mariners: for he ought not only to be iuſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt himſelfe, but alſo vſe the miniſterie of honeſt people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; and therefore the Maſter of the ſhip is no leſſe bound for their perſon, than his owne. The Paſſengers againe are honeſtly and readily to pay the Maſter of the ſhip their fraught, and all ſuch other charges of dyet, and other prouiſion as they haue put him to; wherein if there be any default of any ſide, the Law affordes an action called <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> whereby the one or the other may be relieued.</p>

            <p>The Perpetuall right that is betwéene Paſſengers and Paſſengers, and Saylers and paſſengers is, that in caſe of eiectments, and caſting out of goods, and other marchandize into the Sea in time of tempeſts, or other dangers, by rocks or quick ſands, for the lightning of the ſhip, becauſe it is for the common good of all that are in the ſhip, and the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt of the fraught of the ſhip, it be made vp with the common contribution of all: for good reaſon it is that they whoſe goods are ſaued hereby, ſhould againe with their goods redéeme the others loſſe according to ſuch proportion of goods as they haue in the ſhip, and the Law of the Sea allowes,</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:16472:49"/>
But in caſes of Eiectments the Law of the Sea is this, (which was taken from the people of <hi>Rodes,</hi> who in oldtime, were great ſeafaring men, and diſcouerers of ſundry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whoſe Rules euen to this day are holden for good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong al Mariners, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great equitie and indifferencie that is in them) that as well the Maſter or Purſer of the ſhip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhal contribute for the preſeruation of his ſhip, as alſo the paſſengers for ſuch ware as they haue in the ſhip, of what ſort ſoeuer it be, albeit happily it be but of ſmal waight, as pearls, pretious ſtones, and ſuch like; and if perchance there be ſome paſſengers in the ſhip, who haue no ware nor marchandize in it, yet becauſe themſelues are a burthen to the ſhip, eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is to be made of his or their apparell, rings, and Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, according to which he or they are to contribute towards the loſſe of ſuch things as are caſt out into the ſea: neither is there any thing in the whole ſhip excepted, ſaue onely thoſe things which are put therein to be ſpent, for the common good of all, as victuals, fuell, and ſuch like; for thoſe things are not brought in for any one priuat mans vſe, but for the benefit and ſeruice of all: and ſo much the rather, for that if victuals faile, or other like neceſſaries want, euery one muſt contribute thereto, or impart of that which hee hath for his owne priuat prouiſion; but of mens owne bodies, vnleſſe they be ſeruants, there is no rate to be ſet, becauſe a fréemans body cannot be eſtéemed.</p>
            <p>In priſing, eſtimate is to be made as well of thoſe things which are loſt, as thoſe things which are ſaued, and the price is to be ſet downe, not for how much they were bought, but for how much they might be ſold, and that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, leſt the contributors ſhould be ouermuch charged. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to the purpoſe that the goods which were loſt, might haue béene ſold for more, for that herein is not regard to bee had of the gaine, but of the loſſe. And if any thing that was throwne out were knowne to be decaied or made worſe by waſhing with ſalt water, it is not to be eſtéemed as a new freſh thing, but the price thereof is to bee abated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:16472:50"/>
Now the contribution is to be made in this manner, firſt the loſſe is to be ſet down, then the rate of thoſe things which are ſaued, out of which muſt bee drawne an equall portion, proportionable to the quantitie of euery mans goods he hath in the ſhip to make vp the loſſe, deducting out of the looſers goods himſelfe, ſo much as is anſwerable to his proportion ſo that hee ſhall neither bee made a cléere ſauer, nor a cléere looſer, but in a certaine quantitie ratable to his part.</p>
            <p>But this contribution is in that caſe to be made, if the ſhip be ſaued; for otherwiſe if a wrack happen, either before the eiectment, or in the eiectment, then whatſoeuer any of the vectors or paſſengers catch is his owne, neither is there any regard to be had of the loſſe of the ſhip, or of the goods, vnleſſe perhaps afterwards they be drawen out of the ſea.</p>
            <p>But here we are to note that neither the things that are thus eiected, leaue to be the firſt owners, neither become his that taks them vp; for becauſe the firſt owner doth not count them for goods caſt away, but ſtill hee beares that mind to them that if he may recouer them, he will hold them as his owne goods, and in conſideration of ſo much as afterward he ſhall recouer the contribution in the reſt ſhall ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Neither if the Maſter of the ſhip himſelfe by violence of the tempeſt, ſhall looſe a Maſte or a Saile, he ſhall be more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed therefore, than a Carpenter to whom a houſe is let out to bee built, ſhall bee allowed for his axe or ſawe, if he breake it.</p>
            <p>Beſide in matters of wracke there is, as it were, a contract betwéene them which haue loſt their goods by ſhipwrack, and them vpon whoſe Lands the ſaid goods are driuen, that the ſame be reſtored to them or their heires, if they come in due time to claime the ſame: and therfore it is preciſely forbid by <note place="margin">L. ne quid. ff. de incendio, ruina, &amp; naufragio.</note> the Law, that no man ſhall meddle with ſuch goods as are wrecked, and ſuch as are proued to haue ſtolne any thing thereout are holden for robbers; for that ſuch goods being caſt on land and recouered out of the ſea, remaine ſtill his who was the owner thereof, and deſcend vpon his heire, neither

And therfore the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, ſaith worthily in this caſe; <hi>If any ſhip at any time by ſhipwrack be driuen vnto the ſhore or touch at any Land let the owners haue it, and let not my Exchequer meddle with it: for what right hath my Exchequer in another mans calamitie, ſo that it ſhould hunt after gaine in ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe as this is?</hi> And yet if no kindred appeare within a yeare and a day, or appearing, proue not the goods ſhipwrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be theirs, the goods come to the Exchequer euen by that Law: ſo much that law condemneth careleſneſſe, which is written <hi>Vigilantibus &amp; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dormientibus.</hi> And with this agrée the Lawes of this Land, as taken out of theſe imperial laws; whereby it is ordered that ſuch goods as are ſaued out of the wrack, ſhal be kept, by the view of the Sherife or ſome other chiefe Officer, and deliuered to the hands of ſuch as are of the place where the goods were found, ſo that if any ſue for them and proue them to be his, or to haue periſhed in his kéeping, they ſhal be reſtored vnto him without delay; otherwiſe they eſcheat vnto the king, or to him to whom the king hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame: And if any conuey away any part of the ſame goods contrary to the law, and bee attainted therof he ſhalbe awarded to priſon, and make fine at the kings wil, and yeeld damages vnto the party grieued: and a wrack by the lawes of this land, is where all liuing things within the ſhip doe periſh, but if a man, a dog, or a cat doe ſcape out of the ſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, it is otherwiſe.</p>

But here muſt we note, that matters of repriſals are no Pyracies, although many times there fals out no leſſe outrage in them, for ſpoiling and ſlaying of men, than doth in the other: for that Repriſals are done by the princes commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, graunted to the ſubiect for redreſſe of ſome iniurie done to himſelfe or his ſubiect by ſome other forraine Prince or Subiect, and amends hath bin required by law, and cannot be had, whereupon licence is giuen to the ſubiect to relieue himſelfe by what way he can againſt the other Prince, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſubiects, by taking ſo much goods of his as himſelfe was indamaged; which courſe is held among Princes the rather to affoord Iuſtice where it is lawfully demaunded. <hi>Bartol l. nullus num.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de Iudaeis &amp; Caelicolis.</hi>

the Ciuile Law dealeth incidently and by authoritie of the Prince, &amp; is not the ordinarie obiect of the Ciuile Law, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer otherwiſe they cannot be handſomely dealt in, but by ſuch as haue the ſkill of the Ciuile Law.</p>
            <p>Wherof there be thrée ſort, the firſt is matters of forraine treatie betwéene one prince and another, the ſecond is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of martiall cauſes, whether they bee Ciuile or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in an Armie, the laſt is the Iudgements of enſignes and Armes, and the deciſions for challenges of rights of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and precedencie, where any of them is in controuerſie.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, wheras all other Nations in compaſſe round about vs be gouerned by the Ciuile Law, and treaties are to be decided by law, both for thoſe things which are in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be concluded by Law for thoſe things which are determined by conſultation and agréed vpon; who is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to be choſen rather than a Ciuilian, to whom their law is knowne, as well as to themſelues: and if perhaps he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not their language: yet hee vnderſtandeth that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherein the lawes themſelues are written, and is the fitteſt tongue for treatiſes betwéene Princes and Princes, becauſe it is a common tongue to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all the weſt part of the world, and thereby euery Prince ſhall retaine his owne maieſtie in parlying, as it were, in his owne language, and not be forced to ſpeake in another Princes tongue, which no doubt, is a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to him that ſhall treat; for that euery Nation hath ſome proper <hi>Idiom</hi> not ſo wel diſcerned by the booke-ſpeaker, as perceiued by the Natiues of the country where it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and wherein a ſtranger may eaſily bee deceiued.</p>
            <p>How much forraine Princes doe eſteeme of the ſkill of a Ciuilian in theſe matters, it may bee vnderſtood thereby, that they neuer, for the moſt part ſend any Embaſſage for the treatie of any league or matter of commerce, but that one or moe of them are Ciuilians. And if the care of theſe things bee ſo great with them, ſurely the eſtimation of the ſame ought not to be light with vs: for by what laws their leagues and negotiations are to bee directed, by the ſame muſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16472:52"/>
ours bee ordered, ſo that for that point, one kind of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt ſerue for both; for that otherwiſe one Nation will not bee conceiued by the other what their capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are.</p>
            <p>Surely, ſuch as ouer and beſids their owne experience, haue the knowledge of the Ciuile law, haue herein a double helpe aboue another man that wanteth the ſame. Firſt their owne vnderſtanding, which for the moſt part is of like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as other folkes is: Then the ſkill of the law it ſelfe, which is a quinteſſence of wit aboue other humane learning, as being either wholy compoſed of the mature and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate reſolutions of ſuch Emperours as then ſwayed the whole world, or were the domes and iudgements of ſuch wiſe men, as then managed the whole world and the affaires thereof vnder them. But who, when hee ſeeth a ſword in a ſcaberd, knoweth whether it will cut or not, although the forme thereof bee a preſumption, that it will cut: but doe but drawe it out of the ſcaberd, and try the blade thereof, and then ſhall you ſee the ſharpenſſe of it: I make no application hereof, for that my meaning by my words may be well inough knowne.</p>
            <p>But in theſe matters, the wiſdome of the State knowes beſt what is to bee done, and I onely remember what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations doe, leauing the reſt to their graueſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, who by precedents of former times, and men of experience, furniſhed with exoticke tongues, haue carried this part of policie verie well and ſafely hitherto: but now to the ordering of Martiall cauſes.</p>

            <p>The laſt extraordinary matter that the Ciuile Law Iudge dealeth in, is the bearing of Armes, and the ranging of euery man into his roome of honor, according as his place requires: and here firſt of Armes.

            <p>The third ſort is, of thoſe which are priuat mens Armes, of whom part haue them by the grant of the Prince, or by authoritie of thoſe to whom the Prince hath giuen power to grant Armes to other, as hath the Earle Marſhall within this Realme of England; others haue taken them by their owne authoritie, which albeit in former times they might doe, as alſo they might take ſuch names as euery one did <note place="margin">C. de ingenuis &amp; manumiſſ. l. ad recognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenda ff. de reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuiſione l. ſanctum.</note> like of (for names and ſignes in the beginning were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for to know and to diſcerne one man from an other) and as euery man might change his name, ſo might he change his ſigne, ſo that it were not done in fraud and deceipt: but after

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16472:54"/>
the City, Beſide <hi>Bartol</hi> treateth in that place, what things are borne in Armes, eyther naturall, as beaſtes, birdes, fyſhes, mountaynes, trées, flowres, ſunne, moone, ſtars, or ſuch like: or artificiall, not taken from thinges eriſtent, as colours, ſimple and mixt, deuided by halfes or quarters, or by lines, direct, croſſe, ouerthwart, or ſuch other; then how each of theſe is to be carried, wherein art muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe nature, that euery thing figured, be borne according to the nature of that which it doth figure, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: and therefore as in Enſignes, flagges, or ſtanderds, the ſpeare or ſhaft goeth before, &amp; the ſtreamer or colours follow after, ſo the face of euery creature that is figured or deſcribed in the banner or hatchment, muſt looke vnto the ſhaft or ſpeare; vnleſſe a man beare two creatures, one looking toward the other, for then this obſeruation hath no place, for vaine it is to coniecture where things are certein, otherwiſe it is the nature of the face to goe before, and the body to follow after: and the like reaſon is of the parts of euery creature which is likewiſe borne in Armor, which are diſtinguiſhed by before and behinde, whoſe ſite muſt be ſuch, that the head looke to the ſpeare, otherwiſe would it ſeeme to goe back like a monſter: but if the forepart alone of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be borne in a Scuchin, as often it happeneth that men giue onely a Lion, Beare, or buls head, for their Armes, then muſt not the head directly looke vnto the ſhaft, but aſide: further euery of theſe creatures, be ſo deſcribed in the coate as his vigor and generoſitie be beſt ſet out, whether it be a feirce or ſauage beaſt, or a milde or gentle creature. But for colours his rule is, that the nobleſt colour be put in the firſt part of the field, howſoeuer the coate be deuided, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or pale. And of Colours the golden colour is the chiefeſt, as that which doth figure the Sunne, which is the fountaine of light, which is moſt acceptable to euery mans eye. The next is Purple or Red, which doth figure the fire, that is the higheſt &amp; nobleſt of the foure Elements, and next the ſunne it ſelfe in dignitie. The 3. is Blew, of the Heralds called Azure, &amp; <hi>Ceruleus</hi> in Latin, which figureth the Ayre, which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16472:55"/>
is a cléere and tranſparant body, and moſt capable of light, and commeth in nobility next after the fier. The 4. is white, which commeth néere to the Light, and therefore is more noble than Blacke, that draweth néere to darkneſſe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the baſeſt of all Colours. And for mixt colours, as euery one hath more or leſſe of White or Blacke, ſo eyther they are nobler or baſer in reputation or degrée. And thus much in generall as concerning the knowledge of Armes.</p>
            <p>Now followeth what the Ciuile Law holdeth as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Princes, and other Honorable perſons, and their ſucceſſions and places, which a graue Iudge of this land <note place="margin">

            <p>By the Ciuile Law, all power commeth from God, as the Scripture teacheth, and among powers the two greateſt are the Empire, and the Prieſthood; for as God hath ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the one to rule the outward man, and to bring all his actions within the compaſſe of reaſon, &amp; ſo to eſtabliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes, and to order the ſame: So alſo hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the other for the inſtruction of the inward man, and the planting of Religion among men.</p>
            <p>By the Empire, I vnderſtand not only the Empire of Rome (which ſometimes bare rule ouer moſt part of the world, at the leſt ten mightie Kingdomes, which now are growen into particuler Empires and Monarchies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) but alſo euery ſeuerall Kingdome, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no other Emperor than his owne Soueraigne; for howſoeuer they differ in name and title, yet is the office it ſelfe all one: For euery one of them is Gods immediat Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car vpon earth in their owne kingdomes, for matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning vnto Iuſtice.

            <p>And firſt, to begin with the Empire it ſelfe, as the greateſt earthly dignitie vnder God, albeit in the beginning it were raiſed vp by no right, but by vſurpation, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the former gouernment of the State, and challenging to himſelfe, the whole managing of the ſame; yet after it came to an orderly courſe, inſomuch as he that had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of it, diſpoſed it to his beſt liking, by his laſt Will and Teſtament. So <hi>Iulius</hi> himſelfe deuiſed it to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> his ſiſters ſon: and albeit that deuiſe tooke not effect, by reaſon of the treaſon that was wrought againſt <hi>Iulius</hi> owne perſon, ſo that <hi>Octauius</hi> was faine to recouer it by another right, euen by the death of <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues in office; yet that very Will of <hi>Iulius</hi> gaue a pretence to <hi>Octauius,</hi> who after was called <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (becauſe hee did increaſe the Empire with many worthy victories) to ſtand for the inheritance of the Empire, in conſideration of which title the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> more eaſily ſubmitted themſelues vnto his gouernment. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in like ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed it to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> to <hi>Caius:</hi> and ſo it came from one to another, vntill ſome of them by crueltie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe of life, became ſo odious to God and man, that the people roſe againſt them, and bereft them of that liberty, which they had preſcribed in appointing of their Succeſſors, and ſomewhiles themſelues, and ſomewhiles the Soldiors made choiſe of whom they thought good, or by whom they thought beſt to be rewarded.

For both in our late Quéene, and alſo in her ſiſter, (except onely the caſe of Religion, wherein ſhe followed the error of the time, and was carried way more with zeale than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thereby is more to bee pittied than to bee enuied) what is in their gouernment, the wiſeſt Man-Prince in the

For that I may paſſe ouer the reſt of their Heroicall vertues fit for women of their State (ſpecially the late Queene, who was péereleſſe among all Quéenes that euer went before her, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable, as I verily doe beleeue, by any that euer ſhall ſuccéed her) as their magnanimitie whereby they ſubdued, not only their domeſticall enemies, but vanquiſhed euen their forraine foes, were their deſignements neuer ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, not ſhewing any token of diſcouragement either in the treaſonable attempts of the one, or in the malitious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotiments of the other.</p>
            <p>What an excellent work of hers was that, that then when all her neighbour Kingdomes round about her were drunke with the cup of the fornication of the whore of <hi>Babilon,</hi> ſhee alone came out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and ſo continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the end, mauger the threats of the red fierie Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and the floods of water he caſt out of his mouth after her?

            <p>And yet, truth it is, that mens gouernment is more agréeable to Nature than womens is, whom God in the beginning put in ſubiection vnder man, and who for the moſt part are by Nature weake in bodie, and thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to put in execution the great affaires of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and vnſetled in iudgement, and ſo hardly can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that which is right, and ſettle themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: yet by the numeration of certaine ill gouerning Quéens, to conclude a generalitie againſt all gouernment of women, is but an ill kind of arguing, for euen by the

            <p>Of thoſe Titles of the Canon Law, which before haue béene recited, ſome are out of vſe here with vs in the ſingular or <hi>Indiuiduum,</hi> by reaſon of the groſſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they did containe in them; as the Title of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and vſe of the Pal, the title of the Maſſe, the title of Reliques &amp; the worſhip of Saints, the title of Monks, and Regular Canons, the title of the kéeping of the Euchariſt, and Creame, &amp; ſuch other of like qualitie: but yet are retained
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16472:60"/>
in the generall: for in ſtead of them there are ſubſtituted in their places holy worſhips, tending to the like end of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thoſe other did pretend, but void of thoſe ſuperſtitious meanes the other thought to pleaſe God by; and ſo in ſtead of the Maſſe, hath come in the holy Communion; and in place of worſhipping of Saints, hath ſucceeded a godly remembrance, and glorifying of God in his Saints, and ſo of the reſt whereof there is any right vſe within the Church.</p>
            <p>Some other are out of vſe as well among the Ciuile as Criminall titles, becauſe the matter that is therein treated of, is knowne notoriouſly to belong to the conuſance of the Common Law at this day, as the titles of Buying and Selling, of Leaſing, Letting, and taking to Farme, of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, and pledging, of Giuing by déed of gift, of Detecting of Colluſion and Coſenage, of Murder, of Theft, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Théeues, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>And yet, I doubt not, but euen theſe matters, as well Ciuile as Criminall, or moſt of them, were aunciently in practiſe, and allowed in Biſhops Courts in this Land, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Clerkes, to the which I am induced by three reaſons: Firſt, that I find not only the forraine Authors of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, but alſo the domeſticall Authors of the Legantines, being all moſt excellent wiſe men, as the Stories of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ages do report, to haue inacted theſe ſeuerall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to haue inſerted them, not onely in the bodie of the Canon Law, but alſo in the bodie of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes of this Land; and that ſome wiſe men, ſundry years after their ages, did write and comment vpon the ſame, as things expedient and profitable for the vſe of the Church, and the gouernment of the Clergie in thoſe daies; neither of which, I doe preſume, they would haue done, if in thoſe ages there had not béene good vſe and frée practiſe of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that I find in the Code of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> by ſundry Laws, ſome of his own making, ſome other of other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors before his time, euen from the daies of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16472:61"/>
great, biſhops in their Epiſcopall audience had the practiſe of theſe matters as wel Criminal as Ciuile, and to that end had they their Officials or Chauncellors, whom the Law calleth <hi>Eccleſiecdici</hi> or <hi>Epiſcoporum Ecdici,</hi> that is, <hi>Church Lawyers,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops Lawyers,</hi> men trained vp in the Ciuile and Canon Law of thoſe ages, to direct them in matters of Iudgement as well in Eccleſiaſticall Criminall matters, as Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ciuile matters.</p>
            <p>And that theſe, which now are Biſhops Chauncellers, are the verie ſelfe ſame perſons in Office, that aunciently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction vnder Biſhops, and were called <hi>Eccleſiecdici,</hi> it may appeare by that which <hi>Papias,</hi> an old auncient Hiſtoriographer cited by <hi>Gothofred</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations vpon the foreſaid Law <hi>Omnem</hi> in the Code, and title <hi>de Epiſcopis</hi> and <hi>Clericis,</hi> and vpon the §. <hi>Praeterea</hi> writeth of them, who ſaith thus, that <hi>Eccleſiecdici,</hi> or <hi>Ecdici</hi> were thoſe that were ayders and aſſiſters to the Biſhops in their Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, not aſtrict or bound to one place, but euery where through the whole Dioceſſe ſupplying the abſence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, which is the very right deſcription of the Biſhops Chauncellers that now are; who for that they carrie the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops authoritie with them euery where for matters of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and that the Biſhop and they make but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie, are called the Biſhops Vicars generall, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their authoritie ſtretcheth it ſelfe throughout the whole Dioceſſe, &amp; alſo to diſtinguiſh them from the Commiſſaries of Biſhoppes, whoſe authoritie is onely in ſome certaine place of the Dioceſſe, and ſome certaine cauſes of the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, limitted vnto them by the biſhops, and therefore are called by the Law, <hi>Iudices</hi> or <hi>Officiales foranei</hi> as if you would <note place="margin">

And yet becauſe there were ſome things of Lay fee, which the Clergie then had cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of, as yet they haue in ſome meaſure; as cauſes and matters of Money, chattels, and debts, ryſing out of Teſtaments or Matrimonie, becauſe he would haue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer belonged to the Clergie to be vndoubted, excepteth them from thoſe things which belong to the Crowne and dignitie, and leaueth them to the ordering of the Chriſtian Courts; which is nothing elſe but an affirmance of that which <hi>Glanuill,</hi> and the reſt of the auncient Engliſh Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Britton</hi> ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Laſtly the prouinciall Conſtitution <hi>Aeternae de poenis,</hi> made in the dayes of Henry the 3. plainly ſhewes, that in thoſe dayes all perſonall ſuits betwéene eyther Clerke or Clerke, or betwéene Lay men complaynants, and Clerkes defendants (for euer the Plaintife muſt follow the Court of the Defendant, which to the Eccleſiaſticall men then was the Eccleſiaſticall Court) were tried by the Spirituall Law, and not by the Temporall Law: which practize for that it doth accord with the iudgement of thoſe auncient Lawyers that haue bin before cited, and with the Prohibition it ſelfe, which there reſtraineth only calling of Lay men to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſances of matters of Lay fée; it may be a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that theſe things were of the Eccleſiaſticall right in thoſe dayes: from which I ſée not how the Eccleſiaſticall Courts are falne, for I ſée neither Law nor Statute to the contrarie, vnleſſe perhaps they will ſay the Statute of the <note place="margin">25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</note> 25. of H. 8. cap. 19. toke the ſame away, as being hurtfull

to the kings Prerogatiue royall, &amp; repugnant to the Lawes, Statutes, and Cuſtomes of this Realme; which whether they be, or be not taken away by the ſtroak of that Statute, I leaue it to men of better experience in theſe matters than my ſelfe to iudge.</p>
            <p>But yet this I find by experience to be true, That where there are two diuers Iuriſdictions in one Common wealth, vnleſſe they be carefully bounded by the Prince, &amp; an equall reſpect carried to both of them, ſo far as their places, and the neceſſarie vſe of them in the Common wealth requires; as the aduancement of the one increaſeth, ſo the practize of the other decreaſeth; ſpecially if one haue got the countenance of the State more than the other: which is the only cauſe at this day of the ouerflowing of the one, and the ebbing of the other, but it is in his Sacred Maieſtie to redreſſe it, not by taking away any thing from that profeſſion that is theirs, but by reſtoring to this profeſſion, that which is their owne; but hereof <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of the matters that belong to the triall of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, ſome are acknowledged to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in vſe, ſome other are challenged to be but in a certein meaſure in vſe.</p>
            <p>In abſolute vſe are thoſe which neuer had any oppoſition againſt them, which almoſt are thoſe alone which belong to the Biſhops degrée or order; for all things which come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, are either belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Biſhops degrée, or his Iuriſdiction: To his degrée or order belong the ordering of Miniſters and Deacons, the confirmation of Children, the dedication of Churches and Churchyards, and ſuch like, none of which haue béen chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged at any time to belong to any other Law. The ſecond ſort is of them that belong to the Biſhops iuriſdiction, which is partly voluntarie, partly litigious: Voluntarie is, when thoſe with whom the dealing is, ſtand not againſt it, but litigious it is, when it is oppugned by the one part or the other; Of this latter ſort many things in ſundry ages haue bin cald in queſtion, but yet reſcued and recouered againe by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16472:63"/>
the wiſe &amp; graue Iudges themſelues, who haue found the challenge of them to be vniuſt. But what doth belong to either of them in priuat, or what cauſes do appertaine to the whole Iuriſdiction in generall, becauſe they haue bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die particulerly ſet downe by that famous man of worthy memory <hi>Doctor Coſin,</hi> in his learned Apologie for certaine <note place="margin">

            <p>And thus much as concerning thoſe parts of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Law, which are here in vſe with vs: Now it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſhew whereby the exerciſe of that Iuriſdiction which is granted to be of the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſticall cognizance, is defeated &amp; impeached by the Common Law of this Land, which is the third part of this Diuiſion.</p>
            <p>The impeachment therefore is by one of theſe meanes, by <hi>Praemunire,</hi> by <hi>Prohibition,</hi> by <hi>Iniunction,</hi> by <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas,</hi> by <hi>Indicauit,</hi> or <hi>Quare impedit:</hi> but becauſe the fower laſt are nothing ſo frequent, nor ſo harmfull as the others, and that this Booke would grow into a huge vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, if I ſhould proſecute them all, I will only treat of the two firſt, and put ouer the reſt vnto ſome better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Praemunire</hi> therefore is a writ awarded out of the kings Bench, againſt one who hath procured out any Bull, or like proceſſe of the Pope from Rome, or elſewhere, for any Eccleſiaſticall place, or preferment within this Realme; or doth ſue in any forteine Eccleſiaſticall Court, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat or impeach any Iudgement giuen in the Kings Court, whereby the bodie of the offender is to be impryſoned during the Kings pleaſure, his goods forfeyted, and his lands ſeized into the Kings hand, ſo long as the offender liueth.</p>
            <p>This writ was much in vſe, during the time the Biſhop of Romes aucthoritie was in credit in this land, and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16472:64"/>
it was it ſhould be ſo, for being then two like principal authorities acknowledged within this Land, the Spirituall in the Pope, and the Temporall in the King; the Spirituall <note place="margin">25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. 38 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> grew on ſo faſt on the temporal, that it was to be feared (had not theſe ſtatutes bin prouided to reſtraine the Popes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes) the ſpirituall Iuriſdiction had deuoured vp the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as the temporall now on the contrary, ſide hath almoſt ſwallowed vp the ſpiritual. But ſince the forreine authoritie in Spirituall matters is aboliſhed, and eyther Iuriſdiction is agniſed to be ſetled wholy, and only in the Prince of this land, ſundry wiſe mens opinion is, there can lye no <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> by thoſe Statutes at this day, againſt any man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing any ſubordinat Iuriſdiction vnder the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame be in the kings name, or in his name, who hath the ſame immediatly from the King: for that now all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, whether it be Temporall or Eccleſiaſticall is the Kings, and ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Lawes as now are in force, are called the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, and the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Courts; For that the King cannot haue in himſelfe a contrarietie of Iuriſdiction, fighting one againſt the other, as it was in the caſe betwéene himſelfe and the Pope, although he may haue diuerſitie of Iuriſdiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, which for order ſake, and for auoyding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in gouernment, he may reſtraine to certeine ſeuerall kinds of cauſes, and inflict puniſhment vpon thoſe that ſhall go beyond the bounds or limits that are preſcribed them: but to take them as enemies, or vnderminers of his ſtate, he can not; for the queſtion here is not, who is head of the cauſe, or Iuriſdiction in controuerſie, but who is to hold plea thereof, or exerciſe the Iuriſdiction vnder that head, the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or temporall Iudge. Neyther is that to moue any man that the Statutes made in former time againſt ſuch Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, which vexed the King, and people of this land, with ſuch vniuſt ſuits, doe not onely prouide againſt ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe as came from Rome, but againſt all others that came elſewhere, being like conditioned as they: for that it was not the meaning of thoſe Statutes, or any of them, thereby
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16472:64"/>
to taxe the Biſhops Courts, or any Conſiſtory within this land, for that none of them euer vſed ſuch malepert ſawſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the King, as to call the Iudgements of his Courts into queſtion, although they went far in ſtrayning vpon thoſe things and cauſes, which were held to be of the Kings Temporall cogniſance, as may appeare by the Kings Prohibition thereon framed. And beſide the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Prelats of this Land, in the greateſt heat of all this buſineſſe, being then preſent in the Parliament whith the reſt of the Nobilitie, diſauowed the Popes inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie toward the King in this behalfe; and aſſured him they would &amp; ought to ſtand with his Maieſtie againſt the Pope, in theſe and all other caſes touching his Crowne and Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as they were bound by their allegeance: ſo that they being not guilty of theſe enterpriſes againſt the King, but in as great a meaſure troubled in theyr owne Iuriſdiction by the Pope, as the King himſelfe was in the right of his Crowne, as may apppeare out of the courſe of the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; The word <hi>(Elſewhere)</hi> can in no right ſence be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of them, or their Conſiſtories: although ſome of late time thinking all is good ſeruice to the Realme, that is done for the aduancement of the Common Law, and depreſſing of the Ciuill Law, haue ſo interpreted it, but wythout ground or warrant of the Statutes themſelues, who whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make prouiſion againſt forreine authoritie, and ſpeak no word of domeſticall proceedings. But the ſame word <hi>(Elſewhere)</hi> is to be ment and conceiued of the places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the Popes vſed in thoſe dayes, being ſomtimes at Rome in Italy, ſometimes at Auignion in France, ſeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in other places, as by the date of the Bulls, and other proceſſe of that age may be ſéene; which ſeuerall remoues of his, gaue occaſion to the Parliament of inſerting the word <hi>(Elſewhere,)</hi> in the bodie of thoſe Statutes, that thereby the Statutes prouiding againſt Proceſſe dated at Rome, they might not bée eluded by like Proceſſe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Auignion, or any other place of the Popes aboade, and ſo the penaltie thereof towardes the offender might
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16472:65"/>
become voyd, and be fruſtrated. Neyther did the Lawes of this Land at any time whiles the Popes authoritie was in his greateſt pride wythin this Realme, euer impute <hi>Praemunire</hi> to any Spirituall Subiect, dealing in anie Temporall matter, by any ordinarie power wythin the land, but reſtrained them by <hi>Prohibition</hi> only; as it is plaine by the Kings Prohibition, wherein are the greateſt matters that euer the Clergie attempted by ordinarie and domeſticall authoritie, and yet are refuted only by <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But when as certeine buſie-headed fellowes were not content to preſſe vpon the kings Regall iuriſdiction at home, but would ſéek for meanes for preferment by forrein autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to controul the Iudgements giuen in the kings Courts by proceſſe from the Pope; then were <hi>Premunires</hi> decréed, both to puniſh thoſe audacious enterpriſes of thoſe factious Subiects, and alſo to check the Popes inſolencie, that he ſhould not venter hereafter to enterpriſe ſuch deſignements againſt the King and his people. But now ſince the feare thereof is paſt, by reaſon all entercourſe is taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Kings good Subiects, and the Court of Rome, it is not to be thought the meaning of good and mercifull Princes of this land is, the cauſe of theſe Statutes being taken away, the effect thereof ſhall remaine; and that good and dutifull ſubiects ſtepping happily awry in the exerciſe of ſome part of their Iuriſdiction, (but yet without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Prince, or his Regall power) ſhall be puniſhed with like rigor of Law, as thoſe which were moleſters, grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and diſquieters of the whole eſtate. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the edge of thoſe <hi>Premunires</hi> which were then fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, remaine ſharpe and vnblunted ſtill againſt Prieſts, Ieſuits, &amp; other like Runnagates, which being not content with their owne natural Princes gouernment, ſéek to bring in againe, that and like forrein authoritie, which thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made prouiſion againſt; but theſe things I leaue to the reuerend Iudges of the land, and others that are ſkilfull in that profeſſion, onely wiſhing that ſome which haue moſt inſight into theſe matters, would adde ſome light vnto them,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16472:65"/>
that men might not ſtumble at them, and fall into the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them vnawares: but now to Prohibitions.</p>
            <p>A Prohibition is a commaundement ſent out of ſome of the Kings higher Courts of Records, where Prohibitions haue bin vſed to be graunted, in the Kings name, ſealed with the ſeale of that Court, and ſubſcribed with the Teſte of the chiefe Iudge, or Iuſtice of the Court from whence the ſaid Prohibition doth come, at the ſuggeſtion of the Plaintife, pretending himſelfe to be grieued by ſome Eccleſiaſticall or marine Iudge, in not admittance of ſome matter, or doing ſome other thing againſt his right, in his or their iudiciall procéedings, commaunding the ſaid Eccleſiaſticall or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Iudge to proceed no further in that cauſe: &amp; if they haue ſent out any cenſure Eccleſiaſticall or Marine againſt the plaintife they recall it, and looſe him from the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of the Kings high indignation vpon pretence that the ſame cauſe doth not belong to the Eccleſiaſticall or Marine Iudge, but is of the temporall cogniſance, and doth appertaine to the Crowne and dignitie.</p>
            <p>Prohibitions, ſome are Prohibitions of Law, ſome other are Prohibitions of fact.</p>
            <p>Prohibitions of Law, are thoſe which are ſet downe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law or Statute of this Land, whereby Eccleſiaſticall Courts are interdicted to deale in the matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſuch as are all thoſe things which are expreſſed in the kings Prohibition; as are alſo thoſe which are mencioned by the ſecond of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, where Iudges Eccleſiaſticall <note place="margin">

law, and therfore ought to haue no more fauour in any wiſe, honourable, or well ordered Conſiſtorie, than the equity of the cauſe it ſelfe doth deſerue; for ſuch manner of ſhifts (for the moſt part) bréed nought elſe but matter of vexation, and haue no other commendable end in them, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the right of the Kings Court, as thoſe other Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the law doe: but the Kings right is not to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by imagination, but is to be made plaine by demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo both the Statute of the 18. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Capite</hi> 5. is, where it is prouided no Prohibition ſhall goe out, but where the King hath the cogniſance, and of right ought to haue; and alſo by the forenamed Statute of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixt, which forbids that any Prohibition ſhall bee graunted out, but vpon ſight of the libell, and other warie circumſtances in the ſaid Statute expreſſed: by which it is to bee intended the meaning of the Lawgiuers was not, that euery idle ſuggeſtion of euery Attorney ſhould bréed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, but ſuch onely ſhould bee graunted, as the Iudge in his wiſdome ſhould thinke worthy of that fauour, and of right and equitie did deſerue it: although (as I muſt déeds confeſſe) the Statute is defectiue in this behalfe for to exact any ſuch preciſe examination of him in theſe caſes, as it is alſo in other points, and is almoſt the generall imperfection of all ſtatutes that are made vpon Eccleſiaſticall cauſes: but (I feare me) as emulation betwéene the two lawes, in the beginning brought in theſe multitudes of Prohibitions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt or beſide law, ſo the gaine they bring vnto the Temporall Courts maintaineth them; which alſo makes the Iudges they ceſſe not coſts and damages in caſes of of Conſultation, (although the ſtatute preciſely requires their aſſent and and aſſignement therin) becauſe they would not feare other men from ſuing out of Prohibitions, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Prohibitions of the law, as haue beene before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are neither many, nor much repined at, becauſe they containe a neceſſarie diſtinction betwéene Iuriſdiction and Iuriſdiction, and imply the kings right, and ſubiectes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16472:66"/>
but the Prohibitions of fact or of men, are both infinit and odious, for that there is, well nigh, no matter either Ciuile or Eccleſiaſticall, bee it neuer ſo cléere or abſolute, but they clog it and incumber it with ſome Prohibition; and the matter they conteine, is (for the moſt part) abſurd and friuolous, as ſhall firſt appeare in Marine cauſes, and after in Eccleſiaſticall matters.</p>
            <p>For Marine cauſes, it is well knowne, that all ſuch bargaines and contracts, or as it were contracts, as are made by any perſons either in any forraine country, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hauen or créeke of the Sea, or any ſhoare thereof, as far as the greateſt winter waue doth run out, or vpon any great riuer, to the firſt bridge next to the Sea, for any marchandize, ſhip, tackle, or other negotiation belonging to the Sea, or to any marchandize brought from beyond the Sea, is and ought to bee of the admirall cogniſance, and ſo euermore hath béene ſince the Court of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie was firſt erected: and yet the Common Lawyers to defeate the Ciuile Law of the tryall thereof haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſundry actions, and among the reſt, an action of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whereby they faine, that a ſhip arriued in Cheapſide or ſome other like place within the citie, and there the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife and Defendant meeting together, bargained vpon ſome marchandize, or other like ſea-faring matter, by which fiction they pretend, the bargaine now is to bee tryed in the Common Law, and not by the Ciuile Law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in the bodie of a Countie, and not vpon the maine Sea, or any other place ſubiect to the Admirall Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>But that this fiction, or any other like qualitied to this, ſhould haue any ſuch force as to worke any effect in Law, I will ſhew, firſt by the definition of a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then by thoſe things that are neceſſarily attendant thereon.</p>

For firſt, vnleſſe there becauſe why, that which is not, ſhould be famed to be, and that which is, ſhould bee accounted not to bee, and that which is done in one ſort, or at one time, or in one place, ſhould be imagined to be done in another ſort, at another time, and in another place, there is no reaſon a fiction ſhould be admitted: for the Law alloweth no man to come to extraordinarie remedies, but where ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie remedies faile: and therefore if that which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie may be obtained by any other meanes than by a fiction, a fiction is not to be afforded: but if ordinarie means cannot be had, then fictions may be entertained to ſupply the <note place="margin">L. in cauſa. ff. de numrib.</note> defect of the ordinarie meanes, that thereby, although the truth bee otherwiſe, yet the effect of the Law may bee all one.</p>

            <p>Now, if theſe things be true, as in all reaſon and ſhew, by former precedents they appeare to be true, I would gladly ſee how actions of Trouer, (whereby the Common Lawyers tranſlate vnto themſelues matters of Marine triall) if they be ſquared to theſe Rules of Fictions, can be maintained: for firſt to ſpeake of equitie, which the Law requires in theſe manner of proceedings, what equitie can it be to take away the triall of ſuch buſineſſe as belongeth to one Court, &amp; to pul it to another Court; ſpecially, when as the Court from whence it is drawne, is more fit for it, both in reſpect of the fulneſſe of knowledge that that Court hath to deale in ſuch buſineſſe, and alſo of the competencie of ſkill that is in the Iudges and profeſſors of thoſe Courts, correſpondent to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16472:68"/>
theſe cauſes, more than is in the Iudges and profeſſors of the other Courts, for the deciding and determining of theſe matters. For, albeit otherwiſe they are very wiſe and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient men in the vnderſtanding of their owne profeſſion, yet haue they ſmall ſkil or knowledge in matters pertaining to the Ciuile profeſſion: for that there is nothing written in their bookes of theſe matters, more than is to be gathered out of a few Statutes of former time, whoſe driſt was not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any doore vnto them, to enter vpon the admirall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to preſerue the Kings Iuriſdiction from the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall incrochment, as may by the ſaid Statutes appeare; wheras contrarily, the Ciuile law hath ſundry titles included in the bodie thereof concerning theſe kind of cauſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the interpreters of the Law haue largely commented, &amp; others haue made ſeuerall Tractats thereof: So that, by all likelihood, theſe men are more fit and better furniſhed to deale in this buſineſſe, than any men of any other profeſſion, as hauing, beſide the ſtrength of their owne wit, other mens helps and labors to rely vpon.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this buſineſſe many times concerns not only our owne countrimen, but alſo ſtrangers, who are parties to the ſuit, who are borne, and doe liue in countries ordered by the Ciuile Law, wherby they may be preſumed they haue more ſkill and better liking of that Law, than they can be thought to haue of our Lawes and our procéedings: and therefore it were no indifferencie to call them from the trial of that Law, which they, in ſome part know, and is the Law of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (as it is almoſt to all Chriſtendem beſide) to the tryall of a Law which they know in no part, &amp; is méere forraine vnto them; ſpecially when the Princes of this Land haue aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently allowed the Ciuile Law to bee a Common Law, in theſe caſes, as well to their owne ſubiects, as it is to ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Further, the auocating away of cauſes in this ſort from one Iuriſdiction to another, ſpecially when the cauſe hath long depended in the Court from whence it is called, inſomuch as now it is ready to ſentence, or rather is paſt ſentence, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16472:68"/>
ſtands at execution, cannot be but great iniurie to the ſubiect after ſo much labour loſt, and money ſpent in waſte, to begin his ſuite a new againe: which is like to <hi>Syſiphus</hi> puniſhment, who when he hath with all his might, forced his ſtone vp to the top of the hill, and ſo is (as himſelfe hopes) at an end of his labour; yet the ſtone rowles downe againe on him, and ſo his ſecond labour (his ſtrength being ſpent with the toile of the firſt) is more grieuous than the former was: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſemblably true in a poore Clyent, who hath his cauſe in hearing, there can bee no equitie in this fiction, whereby a cauſe ſo néere ended, ſhould againe bee put vpon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as though it were ſtill rough worke and new to bee begun.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, as there is no equitie in it, ſo there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie ſuch a fiction ſhould be maintained by Law; for that it hath no ground of reaſon to reſt his féete on. For if this be graunted, that ſuch a fiction by Law may be made, then one of theſe abſurdities muſt needs follow, either that a ſhip may ariue in a place where no water is to carrie it, or if that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue according to the fiction, either the people, their houſes &amp; their wealth ſhall be all ouerwhelmed in the water, as the world was in <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, and <hi>Deucalions</hi> Deluge, and ſo no bodie there ſhall be left aliue to make any bargaine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the Mariners and ſhipmen that arriue there; or that the people that dwell there ſhall walke vpon the water, as people doe on land, which <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe was not able to doe, but had ſuncke, if Chriſt had not reacht his hand vnto him, and therefore far leſſe poſſible for any other man to do. So that it may be wel ſaid (theſe things ſtanding as they do) no ſuch fiction can hold, and that no action can be framed vpon it; for as there is no Obligation of impoſſible things, ſo there is no Action of things that neither Nature nor Reaſon will afford to be done: neither is it to the purpoſe that the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of theſe fictions doe ſay, that in this caſe, the place where the contract is made is not conſiderable, which I take to be far otherwiſe; for that, when that themſelues will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey a Marine cauſe from the Sea vnto the Land, they will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16472:69"/>
lay it to be done in ſome ſpeciall place of a Countie, bee the place neuer ſo vnproper for ſuch an action: for that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of theſe actions, is the place where they were done, as namely that they were done in the bodie of ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or ſuch a Countie, and not vpon the maine ſea, or beneath the loweſt bridge, that is vpon any great riuer next the ſea. And therefore in two emulous Iuriſdictions, when they are ſo deuided, as that one is aſſigned the ſea, the other the land, the place of the action can in no ſort be ſuppreſſed, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupplyed in the roome thereof: <hi>Quod enim vna via prohiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, alia via non eſt permittendum, &amp; quod prohibitum eſt directo, prohibetur etiam per obliquum:</hi> for if this were graunted, then matter enough would be offered to one Iuriſdiction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vp the other, and the Law would be eaſily eluded: which to reſtraine either of theſe Iuriſdictions to their owne place, and to prouide that one in his greatneſſe doe not ſwell vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, hath ſet either of them their bounds and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, which they ſhall not paſſe: which, as it is the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Law, ſo ought either Iuriſdiction in all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſubmit it ſelfe therunto, for that the diminiſhing of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is a wrong to the Prince from whom they are deriued, who is no leſſe Lord of the Sea than he is King of the Land: and therefore, in no ſort, ſuch libertie muſt bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the one directly or indirectly, as that it ſhould bee a ſpoyle vnto the other; which would eaſily come to paſſe, if when as the law alloweth not any man to ſue a Marine by the ordinarie courſe of the lawes of this land, yet a man will follow it by an extraordinarie. But where there is an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of Iuriſdiction, as that it is all by ſea, or all by land, there may a thing be fained to be done in one place, that was done in another place, without any mans preiudice, for that in this caſe, the place is not trauerſable (ſo it be not in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters where time and place is required, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer doe not wander from place to place with the iniurie of the accuſed) for howſoeuer the place and the action is altered, yet the truth of the cauſe remaineth one and the ſelfe ſame ſtill: and ſo far as concerning actions of Trouer in Admirall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16472:69"/>
cauſes. Now it doth follow that I ſhould ſpeak of like preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices that grow to the ſame by actions of Treſpas, but thoſe will I paſſe ouer, for that in ſo ſmall a Treatiſe as this is, I cannot go ouer all: and therefore will I only put the Reader in mind, that there are more deuiſes riſing out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, that infeſt the Admiraltie than one. But now to Wils and Teſtaments wherein they are impeached.</p>
            <p>For matters of Wills and Legacies, they are ſo proper to the triall of the Eccleſiaſticall Law of this Realme, as the profeſſors of the Common Law themſelues, do oftentimes confeſſe and ſay, they haue no more to doe therewith, than the Ciuilian hath to doe with the knowledge of the matters of Franktenement: and yet euen theſe matters of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; Legacies, although Prohibitions be not ſo frequent in them, as they are in the reſt of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, yet they are not quite void of them, and that in ſome points, wherein the verie life &amp; eſſence of a Will doth ſtand.</p>
            <p>For whereas the auncient Romanes, knowing how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect matters of Wils are to forgerie &amp; corruption on the one ſide, and ſuppreſſion &amp; concealment on the other ſide, to méet with all craft &amp; ſubtilty whatſoeuer, which might ſeize on them, did moſt carefully prouide, that there ſhould be ſeuen witneſſes at the leaſt, preſent at the making of euery Will &amp; Teſtament, except it were in time of ſome generall plague or ſickneſſe, when ſo many Witneſſes could not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be had together for feare of infection, or if it were in the Countrie, where there are ſmall multitude of people, and that thoſe witneſſes ſhould be particulerly required to that purpoſe; with diuers other obſeruations and circumſtances tending all to the ſafe and ſure making thereof: which the Eccleſiaſticall Law altered afterward in ſundry points, for that many true Wills were many times ouerthrowen for want of thoſe preciſe ſolemnities, &amp; reduced the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe ſeuen witneſſes, vnto two only agreeably to the Law of God, &amp; the Law of Nations, where that number of witneſſes is allowed, as competent to prooue any matter, ſo that the ſame witneſſes be honeſt &amp; credible perſons, ſuch as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16472:70"/>
whoſe faith is not doubted of. The Common Lawyers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelues in ſundry matters very dangerouſly many times admit one witneſſe, &amp; giue him full credit, and that in matters of great waight &amp; importance; (as though all ſhould be ſquared to their rule, and framed to their compaſſe) If an Eccleſiaſticall Iudge in the probate of a Will, contrarie to the rules of his owne Law, will not admit the teſtimonie of one witneſſe, they forthwith fling out a Prohibition againſt him, as though he had done an offence againſt the Crowne and dignitie, in that he doth not allow thoſe number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the Probate of a Will, that the Common Lawes of this land allow almoſt in euery matter.</p>
            <p>For aunſwere to which, if I ſhould alleage the preciſe forme of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, which to the eſſence of a will requireth this number of two witneſſes, or elſe holdeth it not for a Will (but in caſes <hi>inter liberos, &amp; ad pios vſus,</hi> where the only hand of the Father or Teſtator without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſerueth for a Will, ſo the ſame be knowen to be the Teſtators owne hand, or ſo prooued by compariſon) I would think to wiſe men I had ſaid ſufficiently; but I will not reſt hereupon, but will conuince themſelues, by themſelues: for, doe they I pray you in their owne procéedings, where a Law or Statute requires more witneſſes than one, content themſelues with one witneſſe alone? yea, doe they not in all caſes where a certeine number of witneſſes are appointed to prooue a fact by Law or ſtatute, furniſh the cauſe with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie witneſſes as the caſe deſires, or elſe doe they not accompt the procéeding void?

            <p>But perhaps ſome man will ſay, if credit ſhall not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen oftentimes to one mans teſtimonie, much wickedneſſe will paſſe away vnpuniſhed: for reply to which I aunſwere, it is better to let a bad man ſcape, than to puniſh a good, and although it be true, if a man may excuſe himſelfe by deniall, no man will be found guiltie; ſo alſo it is true on the other ſide, if it be ynough to condemnation to be charged by one man alone, without any other witneſſes, no man ſhall be innocent, and therefore the admittance of one witneſſe in cauſes, and the procéeding thereupon to iudgement is verie dangerous.</p>
            <p>An other like bar to this they lay in againſt Eccleſiaſticall procéedings in matters of Teſtament; whereas an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Iudge prooueth a Will, wherein are mannors, lands, tenements, and other like hereditaments bequeathed, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging this alſo to be of the Crowne and dignity, as though the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge thereby tooke vpon him to decrée which lands were deuiſable by will, and which not, or would by his probat adde a ſtrength vnto the Will, to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe good or bad, whereas on the contrarie part the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Iudge by this act doth only teſtifie, that ſuch a perſon made ſuch a will, &amp; that the ſame was prooued before himſelfe vnder his Teſte, for his laſt will &amp; teſtament: but for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie of the Will it ſelfe, and the Legacies &amp; deuiſes therein, whether they were of lands or tenements, or of goods or chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, the Probat it ſelfe worketh nothing, but leaueth that to the Law, Common or Eccleſiaſtical, according as the bequeſt belongeth to either of them, whether it be good &amp; vailable in Law, or no: for it oftentimes falleth out, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16472:71"/>
Will be lawfully prooued before the Ordinarie, yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts are not good, eyther in reſpect of the perſon to whom the bequeſts are made, or in reſpect of the thing that is not deuiſable in all, or in part; as by the Common Law, lands in <hi>Capite</hi> cannot be deuiſed, more than for two parts, but in Socage the deuiſe is good for all; And by the Cuſtome of the Citie of London, &amp; ſome other places of the land, a man can bequeath no more than his deathes part, and if he do, his bequeſt is void for the reſt; but in other places of the land a man may bequeath all. By the Ciuile Law a man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath nothing to a Traytor, or an Hereticke, or an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Colledge, or Companie (vnleſſe perhaps it be for the aliment, or maintenance of them in extreame pouertie, that they dye not for hunger, which is the worke of charitie) and if he doe, the legacie thereof is void to all intents &amp; purpoſes. So then, the Probate of the Ordinarie in matters of land, neyther helpeth, nor hindreth the right of the deuiſe it ſelfe, but is a declaration only of the dead Mans doome vttered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch, and ſuch witneſſes: which taketh his ſtrength not ſo much from the Probat, as from the Law, and is teſtified only by the Probat, that the ſame was declared by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, in the preſence of the witneſſes therein named, to be his true &amp; Laſt Will. So that no man herein is to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Ordinary, as preſuming of a matter not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning vnto him: for this teſtification in all Law &amp; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth belong vnto him, to giue allowance ſo far vnto tho defuncts Will, as it is auouched before him to be his laſt act and déed in that behalfe: but rather they are in this caſe to thank the Ordinary, that he by that act of his hath preſerued the memorie of that, which otherwiſe perhaps would haue bin loſt &amp; periſhed, to the great hurt of the Common wealth, and others which haue priuate intereſt therein.</p>

            <p>And that this was the intent of the king, when he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Church into his protection, with all the priuiledges therof, may appeare hereby, that hauing vnited both the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions in his owne perſon, hee did not iumble them both together, as now they are, but kept them diſtinct, one from the other; not only in authoriſing the Eccleſiaſticall Courts that were before, but alſo in vſing the verie words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the Iuriſdictionaries Eccleſiaſticall did vſe euery where in their writings, euen theſe words whereupon men now take hold to frame Prohibitions vpon, viz. (according to the laudable cuſtoms &amp; vſages of the pariſh and places where ſuch Tythes growe) which were the words of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the Decretals vpon the title of Tythe long before theſe ſtatuts were made, or any other ſtatuts concerning the true payment of tyths; and Linwod in the ſame title of tithes often vſeth the very ſelfe ſame words and phraſes that the other doth: ſo that if theſe words made no Prohibition before the ſtatute (as I think, it cannot well be ſhewed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie) neither ought they to do it now ſince the ſtatute, for that they are taken ſtill in the Church buſineſſe, and not in a temporall matter: whoſe gouernment, although it be vnder one and the ſelfe ſame Prince that the Temporall ſtate is, yet is it diſtinct from the ſame, as euer it hath bin ſince there hath bin any ſetled forme of Church gouernment many common <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.</note> wealth, as may appear both by the example of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which neuer goeth to any temporal power to puniſh the inceſtuous perſon, although there were ſundry lawes then both in Gréeke and Latine written of theſe matters, but doth it by the ſpirituall ſword alone: and alſo by that, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iar for worldly cauſes betwéen brother and brother, he forbids ſuch as were new Chriſtians, to go to law before <note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.</note> Infidels, but aduiſeth them rather to appoint Iudges among

themſelues to decide ſuch controuerſies: which, albeit in thoſe daies was ment as wel of lay Chriſtians, as of the miniſters of the Goſpell, for that the number of them then was ſmall, and the cauſes of ſuit they had one againſt another were not many, and might eaſily be ended by one and the ſelfe ſame conſiſtorie; yet when the number of the Chriſtians increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Church got ſome reſt from perſecution, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction was againe diuided, and as there were Seculer Courts appointed by Princes, wherin Temporal mens cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Lay buſineſſes were heard, ſo there were alſo by the ſame authoritie erected Eccleſiaſticall Courts and Biſhops <note place="margin">C. de epiſcopall audienta t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that this was no new deuiſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, or <hi>Edward</hi> his ſonne, that when they tooke vpon them the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie ouer the Church, as they had before ouer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, they did not miſhmaſh both the ſtates together, and made one confuſed heape of them both, but left them ſeuered as they found them, only affording either of them an equall proportion of protection; for that by theſe two parts, the kings Monarchie is compleat, and himſelfe is the head and chiefe Gouernour of the whole and entire bodie of his Realme. For this was exemplaried vnto them in all former ages ſince the Church and common wealth had any louing and kind cohabitation together, as hath béene before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. And therefore doe they wrong to the aſhes of thoſe kings deceaſed, which by ſubtill ſence and ſtrained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, draw theſe Lawes which they intended for the benefit of the Church, and Church gouernment, to the ouerthrow of the ſame, as though the Poſitiue Lawes of the kingdome could not ſtand, if the Lawes of the Church continued and ſtood vp right.</p>
            <p>Vpon the ſame words of the ſame Statute, (if perhaps at any time there grow any controuerſie about the limits or hounds of Pariſhes) they draw the ſame by like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie from the triall of the Eccleſiaſticall Law vnto

But that now the diuiſion of Pariſhes doth ſerue to other politike vſes, it comes not of the firſt inſtitution thereof, which was méere Eccleſiaſtical: but it groweth out of a ſecond cauſe, that is becauſe beeing ſo fitly and aptly primarily diuided by Eccleſiaſticall men as they are; the Princes therefore did vſe the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereof for Temporall ſeruices, ſubdiuiding the ſame againe into many Tythings or like ſmaller diuiſions, for the more ſpéedie ſeruice of the king, and better ordering of the common wealth. Which our auncient Fathers well knowing, neuer called the ſame in queſtion, acknowledging therein the good they had receiued from Eccleſiaſticall men, by this partition of Countries into Pariſhes: but men of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age being leſſe thankfull than they, and loath to ſéeme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Eccleſiaſticall Courts for any matter of good order and diſpoſition, haue arrogated the ſame wholy to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Courts; as though the Eccleſiaſtical Iudge could not as well diſcerne what two or thrée honeſt men depoſe and

ſay, as concerning the limits or bounds of a Pariſh, as twelue meane men of the countrie, who are vpon like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to giue vp their verdict. But for the limits of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprickes, I acknowledge that they are Temporall, for that they were not primarily deſigned out by Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men, and theyr direction, but were aſſigned to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, or Shires, firſt deſcribed and diſtynguiſhed by Princes: but for Pariſhes, neyther reaſon nor antiquitie concurs with them, that they ſhould be temporall, or that they ſhould be vſurped or challenged to be of the temporall cogniſance.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for thoſe Prohibitions, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly frame out of the 27. and 32. of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, not that there are no more but theſe, but that hauing a taſte of theſe, there may be like Iudgement made of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Out of the ſtatute of the 2. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. they vpſtart many Prohibitions, the firſt whereof in order of the Statute, although the laſt in practiſe is the prohibition of treble damages, vpon not diuiding and ſetting out of Tythes, or at the leaſt, for the not compounding for them before they be carried away: Which forfeiture they ſuggeſt, and thereupon bring a Prohibition, and ſo draw the whole ſuit of Tythes into their Courts, contrary to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Statute, which would thoſe treble dammages, in caſe of not iuſtly diuiding and ſetting out, or not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding for the Tythes before they be carried away, be no leſſe recouerable before an Eccleſiaſtical Iudge according to the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Law, than the forfeyture of double value, by the letting and ſtopping of them to be caried away, whereby they are loſt, with the coſts thereon growing, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable at the ſame Law: For albeit the clauſe which is to redreſſe this wrong, be put after that part of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, which concernes the ſtopping and letting of Tythes to be carried away, yet when there is as great reaſon it ſhould ſtretch it ſelfe to the firſt branch of the prouiſion, as to the ſecond, and the ſecond branch hangeth on the firſt by

            <p>Beſide if the principall cauſe it ſelfe be triable in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Court, why ſhould not thoſe things which hang thereon be tried in the ſame Court, for they are but as it were acceſſaries to the principall, and ſo not only follow the nature of the principall, but alſo belong to the Court of the principall, and are determinable where the principall is, for otherwiſe happily there might fall out contrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of one and the ſelfe ſame thing, the one condemning, the other abſoluing.</p>
            <p>Further in that Court wherein the courſe of Iuſtice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is begun, the cauſe may with leſſe labour and eaſier expences be ended, being both for the moſt part determinable by one ſentence, than that a new proceſſe thereof ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin before an other Iudge, who knoweth little or nothing of the principall matter, and therefore cannot ſo eaſilie decide the acceſſarie.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, thoſe which take this courſe, firſt to ſurmiſe a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyture, then to draw the originall ſuit, whereupon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyture grew into queſtion, bring in a proceeding far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common ſtyle of all well ordered Courts, in all Nations, among whom the cognuſance of the cauſe, &amp; triall thereof goeth before, and the forfeyture or execution thereof
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16472:78"/>
followeth after: But in this <hi>Hyſteron proteron,</hi> the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the foreward, and the triall is in the rereward: In which doing they deal much like as <hi>Cacus</hi> the Giant dealed with <hi>Hercules</hi> oxen, who to thintent that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhould not find what way they were gon, drew them backward by the tayle into his Caue; but as that deuiſe ſetued not <hi>Cacus,</hi> but that <hi>Hercules</hi> had his oxen againe, ſo it is to be hoped the Reuerend Iudges of the land, will not long ſuffer this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie to preuaile, but as it came in like a Fore, and raigned as a Wolfe, ſo in the end it ſhall dye and vaniſh away like a vaine deuiſe, much like the deſtinie of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight: for the reuerend Iudges are not only to miniſter Iuſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man &amp; man, ſo that euery man may haue his owne, and none be eppreſſed of an other, but alſo they are to carrie an vpright and indifferent hand betwéene Iuriſdiction and Iuriſdiction, yea, though themſelues be parties to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion, ſo that one Iuriſdiction eat not vp an other, as the Locuſts in Egipt deuoured vp all the greene things of the land.</p>
            <p>An other Rendeuous they make of the words of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo (Law, ſtatute, priuiledge, preſcription, or compoſition reall) as though all which paſſeth vnder any or theſe tearmes belongeth to the triall of the Common Law, and not to the cogniſance of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, and that forſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe words and tearmes are expreſſed in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: which is much like vnto that, as one would needes haue a houſe, to be Maſter Peacocks houſe, becauſe he ſaw a Peacock ſit vpon the top thereof: But it is not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a thing in a Law or Statute, that makes it to be of the Temporall cogniſance, or otherwiſe: but it is the nature or qualitie of the thing named, that rangeth it vnder the one Law, or the other. So that if the matter ordered in the Law or Statute be temporall, the cogniſance ſhall be Temporall, if Spirituall, then the caſe is determinable in the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Law: for this Prouiſo is not prohibitorie, as the laſt Prouiſo of this ſtatute is, whereby Eccleſiaſticall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are forbidden to hold plea of any thing that is in the ſaid
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16472:79"/>

            <p>And for the other words, Law and Statute therein mentioned: when as the King hath two Capacities of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in him, the one Spirituall, the other Temporall, and his high Court of Parliament, wherein Lawes are made, doth ſtand aſwell of Spirituall men, as Temporall men, and ſo ought to ſtand in both houſes, if the auncient booke, <hi>De modo tenendi Parliamenti</hi> be true and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which makes the vpper houſe of thrée ſtates, the Kings Maieſtie, the Lords Spirituall, and the Lords Temporall; and the Lower houſe in like ſort of thrée other, the Knights, the Procurators for the Clergie, and the Burgeſſes; and his Maieſtie hath wythin this Realme aſwell Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Lawyers, as Temporall, which are no leſſe able to iudge and determine of Eccleſiaſticall matters, than the Temporall Lawyers of temporall buſineſſe: It is not to be imagined, but as his ſacred Maieſtie will haue thoſe Lawes to be held Temporall, and to haue their conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from Temporall Lawyers, which are made and promulged vpon Temporall rights and cauſes: So alſo his Highneſſe pleaſure is, and euer hath béene of all his predeceſſors, Kinges and Quéenes of thys Land, that ſuch Lawes and Statutes as are ſet out and publyſhed vpon Eccleſiaſticall thinges and matters, ſhall bee taken and accompted Eccleſiaſticall, and interpreted by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Lawyers, although eyther of them haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably each others voyce in them to make them a Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:16472:79"/>
And that the King doth infuſe life into eyther of the Lawes, when as yet their ſubſtance is vnperfect, and they are as it were Embreos, is in Temporall matters, by his temporall authoritie, and in Spirituall matters, by his ſpirituall authoritie, for to that end he hath his double dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in that place, as alſo the Eccleſiaſticall Prelates ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine two perſons in that place, the one as they are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, the other as they are Biſhops: So that euen the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the houſe doe euince, that they are two ſortes of Lawes in that place vnconfounded both in the head and the bodie, although for communion ſake, and to adde more ſtrength to each of them, the generall allowance paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ouer them all. And as they reſt vnconfounded in the creation of them, ſo ought to be likewiſe in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them: and as the Temporall Law ſortes to the Temporall Lawyers, ſo the Spirituall Lawes or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſhould bée allowed and allotted vnto the Spirituall Lawyers.</p>
            <p>And as the nomination of theſe words Law or Statute in this precedent Prouiſo, makes not the Law or ſtatute Temporall, but remayneth wholie Eccleſiaſticall, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirituall matters it doth conteine, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of him that quickneth it, and powreth life thereinto: ſo much leſſe can the inſerting of theſe tearmes Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Preſcriptions, or Compoſition reall, intitle the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law to the right thereof, or the Profeſſors of the ſaid Law, to the interpretation thereof: for that matters of theſe tytles ſo far as they concerne Tythes, and other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall dueties, haue béen euermore ſince there hath been any Eccleſiaſticall Law in this land (which hath been neere as long as there hath béen any profeſſion of Chriſtianitie with vs) of Eccleſiaſticall ordinance, neyther euer were of the Temporall cogniſance, vntill new of late, that they tranſubſtantiat euery thing into their owne profeſſion; as <hi>Midas</hi> turned or tranſubſtanciated euery thing that he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into gold.</p>
            <p>But here it will not be amiſſe to inquire, (ſince Tythes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16472:80"/>
came in the beginning of the Primitiue Church, wythin a little time after the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the Iewes policie, vnto the Chriſtian Church, and Common wealth, void of all theſe incumbrances, as ſhall appeare after by the teſtimonie of ſundrie of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, which were néere the Apoſtles time) how it comes to paſſe (ſince Tythes are no leſſe the Lords por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion now, than they were then, and in the Patriarkes time before them) that theſe gréeuances haue come vpon them, more vnder the Goſpell, than euer they did vnder the Law: for then neuer any Lay man durſt ſtretch out his hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to diminiſh any part thereof, but he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.</note> with robberie by the Lords owne mouth; and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof, the Heauens were ſhut vp for gyuing raine vnto the earth; and the Palmer worme and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopper were ſent to deuour all the gréene things vpon the earth. And for Eccleſiaſticall men, it is not read any where in the Scripture, that euer they attempted to graunt out anie priuiledge of Tythes to any perſon, other than to whom they were diſpoſed by the Law, or to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie compoſition thereof, betwéene the Lay Iew, and the Lords Leuites: euery of the which haue beene, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempted agaynſt the Church in Chriſtianitie, but executed with great greedyneſſe: ſo far worſe hath béene the ſtate of the Miniſterie vnder the Goſpell, than was the condition of the Prieſtes and Leuites vnder the Law.</p>
            <p>The beginning whereof, although it be hard for me to finde out, becauſe there is ſmall memory thereof left in Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet as far as I can by all probabilities coniecture, this great alteration in Eccleſiaſticall matters, came by two occaſions: the one by the violence of the Laitie, thruſting themſelues into theſe Eccleſiaſticall rights, contrarie to the firſt inſtitution thereof; for when they were firſt recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Chriſtian world, they were receyued and yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, for the benefit of the Clergie only, as in former time vnder the Law, they had béen for the vſe of the Prieſtes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16472:80"/>
and Leuites only: The other was the too too much curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Schoolmen, who beeing not content with the ſimple entertaynment of Tythes into the Church, as the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers of the Primitiue Church receyued them, would néedes ſéek out how, and in what right, and in what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, this prouiſion belongs vnto the Church, wherein they did by their ouermuch ſubtiltie rather confound the trueth, than make that appeare they intended to doe. By the firſt of theſe was brought in that great preſcription, which is called the Preſcription beyond the Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereby Lay men held Tythes in ſée, wythout pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing therefore vnto the Church; and out of that iſſued the reſt of thoſe pettie Preſcriptions, which we now haue, which are nothing elſe but imitations of the firſt. By the ſecond came in Priuiledges, Cuſtomes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or if they came not in wholly by them, yet ſurely were they much ſtrengthned by them; but of eyther of theſe after in their places. But for that of all theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greeuances in the Church, as far as my trading ſerues mée, Preſcription is the eldeſt, and firſt ruſht into the Church, and violated the Liberties thereof; I will firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn thereby, and ſhew vpon what occaſion it firſt ſeyſed vpon the Church, and preuailed againſt her, and then will I ſpeak of the reſt in order.</p>

            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding all this, the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge admitteth all kinds of preſcription beforenamed, and according to the proofes thercon brought, giueth ſentence either to abſolution or condemnation: albeit the reuerent Iudges of the Land, vpon an erronious report made in the eight yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, haue a conceipt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, viz. That no Eccleſiaſticall Iudge will admit any Plea in diſcharge of Tythe, or the manner of Tything, as it is in their ſence taken; and therfore they hold whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the defendant doth alledge in his ſuit for a conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and namely that the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge did allow of the Plaintifes Plea and allegation, and did admit him to the proofes thereon without deniall, are idle ſpeeches, and rather words of courſe than of effect and ſubſtance. And therefore notwithſtanding, whatſoeuer is alledged by the Defendant as concerning the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges well acceptance thereof, it is counted nothing materiall by the Temporall Iudges, for that they haue a preiudicate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge in theſe caſes, and therefore howſoeuer the refuſal be, or be not, they grant out their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition in theſe caſes. And yet if the Iudges Eccleſiaſticall procéedings might be ſéene and vouchſafed to be read before them, it would bee plaine, there were no ſuch cauſe of their hard opinion againſt them; for euerywhere they doe allow ſuch &amp; like allegations. And if perhaps one inferiour Iudge ſhold make refuſal as they pretend, yet could it not be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by another in an ordinarie courſe of appeale, but that there muſt néeds be brought a Prohibition out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law to redreſſe the ſame? vnleſſe happily they can ſhew, it is a generall conſpiracie in the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges, or a Marime in their learning, that they will not or cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Plea of diſcharge in this caſe, which they can neuer doe. And therefore they are to be intreated to change their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16472:84"/>
opinion in this point, and doe not the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges that wrong, as to charge them with ſuch an imputation, whereof their whole practiſe is witneſſe to the contrarie: for it is vnworthy ſuch mens grauitie as theirs is, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto themſelues the inquirie of the truth in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, thus to be miſconceiued and maſked in an errour, and that for ſo many yeares, and not to bee willing to heare the contrarie, which is an obſtinacie in policie no leſſe indurat, than the Papiſts is in Religion, who ſee the truth and will not beleeue it. And ſo far as concerning Preſcriptions and the firſt cauſe and beginning thereof.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth I ſpeake of Priuiledges which are immunities graunted vnto priuat men beſide the Law.</p>

whereas notwythſtanding Prayer is euermore profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, euery where neceſſarie, and neuer dangerous: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Preaching onely profiteth thoſe, that be preſent and doe heare it, and attend vpon it: but Prayer is auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, euen to thoſe that be far diſtant, yea, though they be in the remoteſt place of the world. By which, and other like arguments, they tranſlated away that maintenance that was prouided for the home Paſtors, (who by Gods owne inſtitution, were to watch ouer their Soules) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein and ſtrange Guids, who neuer communicated to their neceſſitie in any heauenly comfort, but only tooke the milke of the flock, and fed themſelues withall. But by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of theirs, ought not Preaching to haue béen diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for albeit Prayer be a neceſſary péece of Gods ſeruice, and ſo neceſſary, that the Soule of man is as it were dead without it; yet is it not equall to the dignitie of Preaching, which God hath ordeyned to be the onely meanes to come to Saluation by: for Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, and without Faith it is impoſſible to be ſaued: for Faith is a gift that purifies the hart, and makes a mans prayers acceptable to God; and therefore neyther of them ought ſo to take place, as that the one ſhould ſhoulder out the other, but they ought ſo to go hand in hand together, as that one ſhould help, aſſiſt, and countenance thother.</p>
            <p>But how theſe annexations of Benefices firſt came into the Church, whether by the Princes authoritie, or the Popes licence, it is verie diſputable, and there are reaſons on both ſides for to ſhew the ſame.</p>
            <p>For whereas there are reported by <hi>Ingulphus</hi> Abbot of Crowland before mentioned, to haue bin viij.

Eccleſiaſtical authority, for that there is nothing extant for the allowance thereof, ſaue the ſeueral Charters of thoſe auncient Kings only: and that I ſhould be rather induced to beléeue that it was done by thoſe Kings authoritie only; I am thereto perſuaded, that I find <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> immediatly vpon the great victorie that he got ouer this kingdome, to haue appropriated thrée Pariſh Churches to the Abbey of Battaile, which he buylt in memorie of his Conqueſt.

            <p>On the contrarie ſide, that I ſhould take it to be a deuiſe of the Pope, I am moued thereto, that I find euery of theſe orders of Religious men were confirmed by one Pope or other; and as they confirmed them, ſo it is like they made prouiſion for them, and that moſt eſpecially this way; and that chiefly after the Lawes of amortiſation were deuiſed and put in vre by Princes: and thereupon it is that we finde ſundry ſorts of annexation made by Popes &amp; Biſhops vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Linwood. c. licet bona memoria. gloſſ. in verb. aſſerunt non ligari. de lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducto.</note> them, euery one in their Dioceſſe: as ſome were made ſo far as concerned the Patronage only, &amp; then had the Monks therein preſentation only: ſome other were made <hi>pleno iure,</hi> and then might the Monkes both inſtitute &amp; deſtitute therin without the Biſhop, and turne all the profit thereon to their owne vſe, reſeruing onely a porcion to him that ſhould ſerue the Cure there: ſome other Churches did they graunt ſimply to them, without any addition of full right, or otherwiſe, and then if the Church were of their owne foundation, they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16472:87"/>
might chuſe, the Incumbent being once dead, whether they would put any other therein, vnleſſe perhaps the ſame Church had people belonging vnto it, for then muſt they of neceſſity ſtill maintaine a Curat there; and of this ſort were their Granges &amp; Priories, &amp; thoſe which at this day we call Donatiues: but if it were of another mans foundation, then was it otherwiſe. To this alſo I adde that, that the Pope euery where in his Decretals, arrogateth this right vnto himſelfe, as a Prerogatiue of the Apoſtolike Sea, to graunt theſe priuiledges to Religious orders, to take and receiue Benefices at lay mens hands, by the mediation of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan whoſe office it was to be a meane betwéene the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe and the Incumbent, for an indifferent rate that neither of them ſhould preſſe too much the one vpon the other: <note place="margin">Gloſſ. in verb. de Decim.</note> and therefore in the beginning, the vſuall rate that they ſet downe betwéene the beneficed man, and the Religious perſon was the one halfe of the Benefice, for that it was not thought that the Pope would charge a Church aboue that rate. But after by the couetouſneſſe of Monkes and Friers themſelues, and the remiſneſſe of the Biſhops, who had the managing of this buſineſſe vnder the Apoſtolike Sea, the Incumbents part came to ſo ſmall a portion, that <note place="margin">Othobon. c. quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam de Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priationibus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum.</note> 
               <hi>Vrban</hi> the fifth, by <hi>Othobon</hi> his Legate here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in the yeare of Saluation 1262. was faine to make a Legantine, whereby he forebad all Biſhops of this Land to appropriat any more Churches, to any Monaſterie, or other Religious houſes, but in caſes onely, where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or places to whom they were appropriated, were ſo poore, as that otherwiſe they were not able to ſuſteine themſelues; or that the cauſe were ſo iuſt, that it might be taken rather to be a worke of charitie, than any inforcement againſt Law: and that beſide with this Prouiſo; as that if the new Proprietaries within ſixe Monethes next after, ſhould not ſet out a competent porcion for the Miniſter, of the fruites of the Benefice, themſelues ſhould aſſigne out a ſufficient maintenance thereout, according to the quantitie and qualitie thereof; Which conſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16472:88"/>
it tooke not that effect that was hoped, there were two Statutes made, the one by <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the <note place="margin">

            <p>Albeit moſt of theſe Appropriations were principally in Monkes and Fryers, and ſuch other Religious perſons, yet were not Biſhops Seas, and Cathedrall Churches, altogether frée from them, as I haue before ſhewed in the Cathedrall Church of Saliſburie, to whom <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt appropriated néere twentie Churches in one day: And the Sea of Wincheſter, which hath had two Benefices aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently annexed to the Biſhops table, the Parſonage of Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane, and the Parſonage of Hambleden. Neither do I doubt, but the like was done in other Biſhops Seas, and other Cathedrall Churches, if I had as good inſtruction to report of them, as I haue had information to ſpeake of theſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning the firſt effect of Priuiledges, whereby ſundry fat Benefices haue béene iniuriouſly dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from their owne Churches, and vnnaturally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Monkries and Fryeries, and other ſeculer and Religious places; which as I haue ſaid, hath béene partly the act of Lay men, and partly of Eccleſiaſticall men. Now followeth the ſecond effect hereof.</p>
            <p>And that is, the exemption of theſe Religious mens poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions from payment of Tythes, which is a priuiledge of the Pope alone: for Monkes aunciently paied Tythes of <note place="margin">Ca. ex parte tua. gloſſ in verb. laborum de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim.</note> their land, before theſe priuiledges, as other Lay men did. But <hi>Paſcalis</hi> the ſecond, caſting a more fauorable aſpect towards Monkes, and other Religious men, than any of his predeceſſors before time had done, did order together with the Councell of Ments, That neyther Monkes, nor other Religious perſons, or any other that lyued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſhould pay Tythes of their owne labors: Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie <note place="margin">Fod. in dea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gloc. verb. laboris.</note> in proceſſe of time, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> recald, ſo far as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16472:88"/>
it concerned the reſt of the Religious perſons, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it onely to the Cyſtertians, Hoſpitallers, Templers, &amp; thoſe which were of the order of S. Iohns in Icruſalem, leauing onely to the reſt fréedome from paying Tythes of landes newly broken vp, and laboured wyth their owne hands, and of their garden, and of their cattell. In which ſtate the matter ſtood vntill <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirds dayes, who although he were in no other point of better mould than the reſt of the Popes were; yet was he in this more pittifull towards poore Incumbents of Pariſh Churches, than any of his predeceſſors had béene; who ſéeing hereby the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences of beggery and ignorance that grew vpon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the Parochian Prieſtes, by meanes of theſe Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ordered in the ſecond Lateran Councell, holden in the yeare of grace 1120. that for ſuch lands as any of the <note place="margin">Ca. nuper Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, de decimis.</note> ſaid fower Priuiledged orders, ſhould acquire and get af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſaid generall Councell, they ſhould pay Tythes, or compound for them as other men did; yea though they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured them wyth their owne hands, or manured them at their owne charges. Which conſideration alſo moued <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, a king of this Realme, to prouide by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, firſt, that ſuch of the order of Cyſtertians, as had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 4.</note> Bulls to be diſcharged of Tythes, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into that ſtate, as they were before: Then, that no <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 6.</note> perſon Religious or Secular, by colour of any Bulls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning any priuiledges, to be diſcharged of Diſmes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to any Pariſh Church, not put in execution, ſhould put the ſame in execution, or ſhould purchaſe the like in time to come.</p>
            <p>Whereby it is verie probable, that few of thoſe landes which are now challenged to be frée of Tythe by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the xxxj. of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight are frée of Tythes in <note place="margin">31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> déed: for that they are no otherwiſe fréed by that Statute, than that they were firſt fréed in the Religious mens hands; ſo that if they were neuer fréed in their hands, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill charged with Tithes.</p>
            <p>But betwéene this interruption of not paying of Tythes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16472:89"/>
wrought by <hi>Innocent,</hi> in the ſecond Lateran Councell, and the diſſolution of Monaſteries effected by <hi>Henry</hi> the viij. are thrée hundred and thirty yeares, and betwéene the foreſaid Statute, made in the ſeuenth yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and the ſubuerſion of the Monaſteries brought to paſſe by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, as hath bin before remembred, are one hundred and thirty yeares. In which long diſtance of time the one from the other, it is not to be doubted but many of thoſe Religious houſes were built and indowed, which by no poſſible meanes could be partakers of thoſe priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which were aboliſhed before the time of their erection: neither was there any reuyuing or renewing of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges by any Pope of Rome, or Prince in this Realme, after they were thus firſt repealed by the Pope and Prince aforeſaid, for oght that I haue read, or heard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
            <p>So that if this matter were well vnderſtood, and the ages and orders of thoſe Religious perſons from whom the clayme is made, were rightly conceiued, it would giue great light vnto the Iudges to diſcerne what lands were exempted from the payment of Tithes, and what not: for now many are pretended to bée exempted from Tythes, which neuer were of any of thoſe fower orders, and if they were, yet were they not before the time of the interruption, but ſince.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning the ſecond effect of theſe Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Now it followeth that I ſpeake a word or two of compoſitions, which are agréements betwéene perſons liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, whereby eyther partie may know their owne right, and not ſtriue againe about doubtfull matters. As good Lawes haue growen out of ill manners, ſo compoſitions haue riſen out of quarrels, cauſed by priuiledges, and other like exemption for matter of Tythe: whereof although there be no ſpeciall Treatiſe in the Law, as there is of the reſt, yet they are ſo often mencioned by the Decretals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as that it is not to be doubted, but that they are part of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, aſwell as the reſt are, &amp; that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16472:89"/>
they are the deuiſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawyers, and not the conceipt of the Common Lawyers, the forme and ſtile of them doth wel ſhew, which ſauoureth wholly the maner and phraſe of writing of the Eccleſiaſtical men, &amp; hath no touch of the Common Law at all. And if the deuiſe bee the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical mens, as all Biſhops Regiſters euery where do ſhew, which are full of theſe compoſitions, why ſhould not alſo the totall be theirs, that euery cauſe might haue his ending, where it hath his beginning? <hi>Eorum enim eſt legem interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And theſe are thoſe grieuances of the Church, which I ſaid the Schoolemens curioſitie in their diſtinctions, either inuented, or gaue ſtrength vnto them after they were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but inuent them all I thinke they did not, for that theſe Acts of appropriations of benefices were ſomewhat more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than the Schoolemen themſelues are: but the reſt of the Priuiledges, they either came into the world with them, or inſued anon after them, ſo that I may well ſay they much ſtrengthened this iniquitie. For when that euery man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by their Doctrin the quotitie of Tythes, or the tenth part thereof was not preciſely by Gods Law (ſince the light of the Goſpell ſprang out as the day light vnto the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who before ſate in darkneſſe, and the ſhadow of death) but that it was by the inſtitution of the Church onely; then began they freely to ſpoyle the Church, of her due Tythes, and to giue away that to one Church, that was due to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the reaſon that perſuadeth the Schoolmen to this, was that after much adoe, diuiding the whole Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> into thrée parts, the Morall, the Iudiciall, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, they did conclude that there were thrée parts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Tythe, the one Morall, which was a neceſſarie maintenance for the Miniſter, and therefore was naturall and perpetual: the other Iudicial, which was the number of ten, fit as they taught for that people onely, and therefore was poſitiue and remotiue: the laſt Ceremoniall, and that was the myſterie contained in this quotitie, or number of Ten, which being but a ſhadow onely, was aboliſhed with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16472:90"/>
the Law it ſelfe: wherby they did (infer the preciſe number of Ten being taken away, by reaſon of the Ceremonie it ſelfe) a competencie now onely doth remaine for the Miniſter out of the Tyths: which opinion hath bin wel confuted of late, by a very learned man, as his Treatiſe therof doth well ſhew; but I fear with leſſe ſucceſſe than the truth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, for this is a point that toucheth many mens priuat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, &amp; therefore ſhal haue no more fauor than it néeds muſt.</p>

Neither can it be thought this number came from the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall part of the Law, as a fit proportion to maintaine one Tribe, out of the reuenewes of the other eleuen Tribes: for that this number or quotitie was reuealed to be Gods long before the Law, and before there was any ſuch diuiſion of Tribes among the people of Iſraell; which yet were not, but were parted afterward by <hi>Moſes</hi> into families according to the number of the Twelue ſons of <hi>Iacob.</hi> And therefore it is not to be preſumed that the Law which came long after, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed a forme vpon that, which was ſo long in being before there was any Law or ceremonie. But as the Apoſtles or prime-Chriſtians, whenas they did firſt change the day of the Sabbaoth by diuine inſpiration or otherwiſe, from the day of the Creation, to the day of the Reſurrection, durſt not ſubſtitute any other day into the place of the firſt day than a ſeuenth; for that the Lord had reuealed his pleaſure in many places of the Scripture as concerning that number, for his day of worſhip, ſo that no other day could be appointed for his day of worſhip than a ſeuenth: So neither durſt the good Chriſtians of the Primitiue Church (moued no doubt with no other inſtinct than the other were, when they tranſlated this prouiſion of tythes for their miniſterie from the Iewiſh Church vnto their owne Church) change the number of ten into another number beſide more or leſſe: For that God had no leſſe manifeſted his will in ſundry parts of the Scripture. as concerning this number, to be a number for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his miniſterie, than he had declared his pleaſure as concerning that other number to be a day for his honour, chalenging it euerywhere in the Scripture, in the very quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie for his owne right, and counting it robberie if it were at any time withholden from him. And therefore it may be well thought, the Schoole-men herein did great wrong to the Church, who by their quaint diſtinctions brought this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie to an vncertaintie, which is no where to be found in the Scripture. Which I am more bold to ſpeak, for that I ſée ſome haue trod this path before me, and ſhewed by good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the turning of this quotitie into a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16472:91"/>
is a thing nothing warrantable by the word of God, but that the quotitie ought ſtil to ſtand as a perpetuall right due to God and his Church. But hereof hitherto.</p>
            <p>And ſo hauing paſſed ouer this whole prouiſo of Law, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Priuiledge, Preſcription, and Compoſition, I might well leaue the turning of this ſtone any more, but that yet there remaineth one Prohibition of preſcription to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which in my fancie is worſe than all the reſt, for that it draweth away from the Parochian Church her maintnance, and tranſferreth it vpon lay men: and that which worſe is, it makes Biſhops to be inſtruments hereof, who are to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and defenders of Churches, and not pillers or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the ſame. And yet the authors thereof doe imbrace it and kiſſe it as a golden birth, or as if that <hi>Iuno</hi> her ſelfe had béene preſent at the Natiuitie thereof. And the deuiſe is this.</p>
            <p>A Biſhop being owner of a Manor yet not diuided into Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies, nor hauing any Parſonage erected vpon it, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the one and diuideth out the other: here the Biſhop being ſeiſed in the whole Manor before the ſaid diuiſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a clergie man, is ſuppoſed to be in poſſeſſion aſwel of the Tythes as of the Manor it ſelfe, and therefore after creating a Parſonage, and diuiding out his Tenancies, may retaine and kéepe to himſelfe, and his ſaid tenants, ſo much of the ſaid Manor diſcharged of tythes as him liſteth, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ouer the reſt for the maintenance of the Miniſter, and that his tenants after may challenge exemption from tythe, as the Biſhop did, for that they were exempted by his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie while they were in his owne hand.</p>
            <p>Neither of which is ſo by Law; for inſomuch as a Biſhop is an owner of a Manor, and is a prime-founder of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he hath no more right to the Tyth thereof than a méere Lay Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their portion would reach vnto; which was a comly thing to behold, acceptable to God, comfortable to their Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; conuenable to their calling: but after the ſame were appropriated to Religious houſes, theſe good courſes were much diſguiſed: for albeit thoſe Religious men, to whom theſe Parochian Churches were annexed, did much pray for thoſe congregation, as they pretended, from whom they had the fat of the Benefices, yet they preached little to them, kept ſmal hoſpitality among them, or did any other ſpiritual work belonging to any Paſtorall charge; yet notwithſtanding the whole inſtitution for which benefices in the beginning were erected, was not altogether extinct in them, but there was ſome outward ſhape or forme of the firſt ordinance left them, ſo far forth, as that they made continual prayers &amp; interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God for them: but when it came once into the Laities hands, there was not ſo much as a footeſtep left of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, for they neyther preach vnto the people, pray for them, nor kéepe any hoſpitalitie among them, but ſpend all the whole reuenues of the Church vpon their priuate vſes, which many times are vnfit for ſuch Spirituall prouiſion to be ſpent in: ſo that for the benefit of the Church, the returne of them might be well wiſht, albeit in ſo far as they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and intricated by the Lawes of this land, with priuat mens ſtates, it would be hard to be performed; for the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them would be much like, as if a man ſhould moue one ſtone in a vauted worke, ſuch as the ſtonie roofes of many Cathedrall Churches and Colledges are, where the taking of one ſtone away is the ieopardie of the whole buylding: But yet let thoſe to whom this doth appertain, conſider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this it were better to pleaſe God, than man.</p>

In eyther of which caſes, if they were Lords of the Mannor, &amp; Parſons of the Parſonage together, it is not to be thought they would ſo reſpect the good of their Farmer, as that they would either hurt their Church, or preiudice their owne Table, for their farmers ſake: which they muſt doe, if they ſuffer a Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to run againſt the Church, or themſelues, to exempt the demeanes of the Mannor from payment of Tythes, which were due both to the Church, &amp; themſelues: For they were men, that both knew in their conſcience, how much they were bound vnto the Church in this behalf; &amp; they were not ignorant what preiudice they ſhould doe vnto themſelues, if by preſcription they ſhould yéeld to exempt ſo neceſſary a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for the maintenance of their Hoſpitality, as the tithes of the demeanes of a whole Mannor, &amp; their tenancies are: for no ſmall part of their commendation ſtood in thoſe dayes in their hoſpitalitie, &amp; therefore it is not to be preſumed that

Which being well conſidered, the concluſion is very doubtful, whither euer any preſcription ran in this caſe, neyther would it eaſilie be beléeued by thoſe that know the courſe of Antiquity, but that there hath a Iudgement paſſed in this part, &amp; therefore will I ſtay my ſelfe here, and proſecute this point no further.</p>
            <p>I intended to ſay nothing in this treatiſe of the Tithes of Minerals, &amp; other ſubterraneous bodies, becauſe I know by Law, they are holden by the like right, as the Tithes of thoſe things are, which grow in the vpper face of the earth; but yet becauſe I ſée there is a queſtion made of them, by ſome that will make euery thing controuerſable, that is due vnto the Church, I will ſatiſfie alſo their curioſitie: And therefore, for Mettals, &amp; other ſubſtances which are digged out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, &amp; therefore are called <hi>Foſſilia,</hi> this is certein, that what God worketh here in the ſuperficies of the Earth, for thoſe things that ſpring out of the earth, by the heat of the Sunne, the temperature of the Ayre, &amp; the influence of the Celeſtiall bodies; the ſame he effecteth below in the depth of the Earth, for the generation of Mettals &amp; other ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodies by the heat &amp; cold of the earth, that is included in <note place="margin">Eraſtus tractat. de ortu Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loram.</note> the bowels therof: For by the heat, he raiſeth vp vapors &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations in the matrix therof, as the matter of thoſe ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous bodies: but by the cold, he dryeth, thickneth, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and indurateth the ſame into a Mettall, or Minerall,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16472:96"/>
whereby he giueth as it were a forme vnto it. And as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of euery exhalation ſo compacted &amp; drawen together is finer or groſſer, hotter or colder, ſo is the Mettall or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or other ſubterraneous body more noble or more baſe: yea, ſomtimes by reaſon of this diuerſitie of exhalations &amp; vapors drawen together at one time, are diuers conditions of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals there confounded together, whereof ſome are noble, as Gold, Siluer, &amp; Copper; ſome other are of leſſe eſtimate, as Tyn, Lead, and ſuch like. Neither do theſe grow only in the beginning, but they renew againe when they are digged vp, (as Trées &amp; plants in the vpper face of the earth do riſe out of the rootes &amp; ſtemmes of thoſe trées which haue bin cut down) if the place of their new generation be prepared accordingly: For whereas the place of their generation is far below in the Earth, nature of a certein modeſty in her ſelfe, will not yéeld to the generation of theſe ſubterraneous bodies, but in ſecret places, far remote from the ſight of the Sunne, &amp; the priuitie of other Meteoricall bodies, which are vnder the firmament. And by that meanes it hapneth, that theſe Minerall bodies are rarely knowen &amp; perceiued to renew againe; for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once expoſed to the light of the Sunne, they are ſeldome or neuer cloſed vp againe, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of the gulfe that is made in opening of them. But yet the nature of them is ſuch, that if their bed were therto prepared according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they would conceiue a new: Which is a thing ſo notorious <note place="margin">

And if theſe bodies do both ingender &amp; renew, which are conceiued ſo far below in the Nauell of the earth,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16472:97"/>
why is not Tythe due of them, aſwell as it is of other fruits that are in the ſummitie or hight of the earth. Whether is it that Gods hand leſſe laboureth in the procreation of theſe ſubterraneous bodies, than it doth in the ripening &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of that fruit that ſprings out of the vpper face of the earth? But that is far otherwiſe, for here in theſe vpper fruites, one planteth, an other watereth, and God only giues the increaſe: But in the other Minerall bodies, God alone doth all, for he only is the planter, he is the waterer, and he giues the increaſe alone. Or is it that God hath leſſe delight to be honored with theſe hid treaſures of the earth, than he hath to be worſhipped with the labour of the plow, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the cattell of the field? But that this is not ſo, it is plaine by the glorious Temple that <hi>Salomon</hi> made, which <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro. ca.</hi> 2.</note> had not only Cedar trées for the roofe therof, and Algummin wood for the ornaments thereof, but alſo had quarrie ſtone for the wals thereof, &amp; gold of Paruaim for the beautifying of it, &amp; for the ouerlaying of it within. And of all other kind of Mettals, gold is firſt remembred in the Scripture, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly <note place="margin">

Or is it that God loueth his Miniſters leſſe than other men, ſo that he would haue the Laity to haue al the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of the earth, &amp; his Miniſters to haue no part of any other thing, but that which is vulgar &amp; common? But how vnlike that is, who ſées not, when he ſéeth that God hath committed vnto them, the ineſtimable treaſures of his word; in compariſon whereof, both theſe vpper fruits of the earth, &amp; thoſe hid treaſures below, are méere droſſe &amp; corruption? and therefore it is not like, when he hath committed vnto them thoſe great matters, he would deny vnto them theſe ſmaller bleſſings. Or is it that there hath bin paid tyths of the vpper fruit of the earth already, &amp; therefore cannot Tythe be twice <note place="margin">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16472:97"/>
whereby it is ordained, that as often as the earth fructifieth in one yeare, ſo often ſhal Tithes in the ſame yeare be paied of it: &amp; alſo it is contrary to Diuinitie &amp; reaſon that it ſhould be otherwiſe. For when as God hath giuen thee more Harueſt or more Vintages in one yeare, is it not both godly and reaſonable, as God hath increaſed his bleſſings towards thee, ſo thou alſo ſhouldeſt riſe in thankfulneſſe towards him? For, wher euery one hath receiue dmore grace or more fauor, there ought he to be more thankful, leſt God for lack of this correſpondencie in thankfulneſſe, bring thy nine parts, for thine ingratitude towards him, to a tenth onely. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſo he is able to doe by ſending deluge and drought vpon the earth, by bringing barrenneſſe vpon it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that which is ſprung out of the earth alreadie, by ſtorme and tempeſt, by the graſhopper and the caterpiller: for all this hath hee threatned to all thoſe that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull this way, neither is the Lords hand more ſhortned now than it was then. Whereas not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the contrary, hee hath promiſed great kindneſſe vnto ſuch as ſhall pay their Tythes truely and chéerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that he will open the windowes of heauen and power out his bleſſings without meaſure vpon them. <hi>Hilarem enim datorem amat Deus.</hi> Beſide this, that earth that bringeth out mettals in the Matrix of the earth, is not that that bringeth out corne and graſſe in the top of the earth: for that earth that is the mother of mettals, being preſt downe far into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the earth, can yéeld no ſuſtenance to thoſe fruits that grow ſo many fathoms aboue it, to which it confers nothing ſaue that it doth ſupport and bear vp that other earth, which nouriſheth the plants and fruits of the vpper earth, whoſe ſuſtenance is not fet déepe out of the earth, but is ſuckt out of that earth which is within one cubit or two of the top of the earth: which may be eaſily perceiued by thoſe fruits and trées that grow vpon hard rocks néer to the top of the earth, whoſe food, although it be néere vnto the top of the earth, yet doe they floriſh and ſtand faſt, as other trées and fruites doe, which haue more fat and déepe mould vnder them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16472:98"/>
cannot the Tything of thoſe things which are aboue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Tything of the treaſures that are below, albeit the concluſion were true, that two thing are not to bee paid out of one ground in one yeare, for theſe are neither one ground, and the concluſion it ſelfe is erronious, and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point thus: Since Mettals and Minerals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubterraneous bodies are in no leſſe Obligation to God, than other fruits of the earth are, there muſt be no leſſe tiths paid of them, than are of other fruits of the earth; for that theſe are the inward fruits of the earth, as well as thoſe are the outward, and therefore of like things, there muſt be like iudgement and like conſequence. And thus much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Tythes of Mettals and Minerals.</p>
            <p>And now becauſe I am in this matter of Tythes, I will ſhape an anſwere to one doubt that is made, as concerning the Tyths of Turues, that is, of earth diſpoſed and prepared for fewel, which are ſaid not to be tytheable, &amp; that vpon this reaſon: That Tyths are not paid of the earth it ſelfe, but of thoſe things which ſpring out of the earth: which opinion is true, if it be vnderſtood of earth not ſeperated from the bodie &amp; maſſe of the reſt of the earth. For if Tyths ſhould be yearely paid therof, as it is paid of other things that grow out of the earth, all the whole earth in a ſhort time would become the Clergies. But if it be meant of earth that is ſeuered from the reſt of the maſſe &amp; globe of the earth, then is it otherwiſe. For that earth that is thus ſeuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other earth is no more part of that earth from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is ſeuered, than a mans hand or leg being cut from the bodie, is part of his bodie after it is cut off from it. And therfore of this earth ſo prouided for fewel may Tyths aſwel be paid as of any other fewel of wood, cole, or otherwiſe that is prouided to be burnt. For there is one reaſon of things when they are vnited together in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, and another of thoſe things when they are diuided from the ſame body: for ſo long as they are in one and the ſelf ſame body, they follow the nature of the whole, but when they are diuided, then is there another conſideration of them. <hi>Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum</hi>

            <p>And ſo far as concerning the Prohibitions which ariſe out of this prouiſo.

            <p>This prouiſo hath two branches, the one for comparatiue barren, heath, &amp; waſte ground, the other for abſolute barren, heath &amp; waſt, for either of which is aſſigned a time of 7. yeers, either for the paiment of ſuch tiths, as before the time of their improuement, and conuerting to errable, they were charged with, or for the frée and abſolute diſcharge of them from all manner of Tythes for ſeuen whole yeares next after
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16472:99"/>
their improuement ended and determined. For ſo I take the Statute meant, when as it made the one Tythable, the other not, for if otherwiſe they had béene both in one predicament of barrenneſſe, the Statute had not made one frée from tithe for ſo many yeares as it doth, and charged the other all that time with Tithe.</p>
            <p>For theſe two kinds of grounds, although the Statute ſay nothing, which is comparatiue barren, which is abſolute, yet reaſon telleth vs, that is Comparatiue that hath a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vnder it, and a Superlatiue aboue it: and therefore that is Comparatiue waſte, barren, or heath, in reſpect whereof there is ſome ouer ground more or leſſe, waſte, heath, or barren, ſo that it hath ſimply and poſitiuely in it ſome condition of heath, waſt, or barren: but if it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any of theſe qualities in it, then is it neither heath, barren, or waſte, howſoeuer long otherwiſe it hath lien vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manured, and not turned to tillage: For it is not the turning of a ground to tillage that makes it heath, barren, or waſte, but it is the il diſpoſition of the ground it ſelfe, ſubiect to theſe inconueniences, that cauſeth it not to be turned to tillage; for no man will willingly till that, where the gaine of the tillage will not quit the coſt and labour of the huſbandry, as for the moſt part it falleth out in theſe grounds they doe not.</p>
            <p>Barren ground therefore ſimply, is that, which being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Gloſ. L. licet.

Waſte is that which for the vnfruitfulneſſe thereof hath laien time out of minde vnmanured, in which ſence it is all one with barren ground; or it is ſuch ground as for the charge of hedging, ditching, fencing, and tilling no man will manure.</p>
            <p>Our forefathers aunciently compriſed all theſe three vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name calling them all by the name of <hi>Noualia,</hi> that is new broken vp ground not only becauſe they were not broken vp in the memorie of man before, but alſo for that being eared, they yeelded little or no fruit at all: and therefore the interpreters of the Law defining what <hi>Noualia</hi> are, ſay that they are ſuch grounds as before the tillage thereof were <hi>inutilia;</hi> and example them out, in Mountaines, Marſhes, <note place="margin">C. commiſſum de decimis verbo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And thoſe are the ſame or coſen German to thoſe which this Statute calleth heath, barren and waſte; for they are one and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf ſame with them, in all the chiefe points, for which they are excepted out of the Statute.</p>
            <p>So then now, there is no further queſtion what is heath, barren, and waſte ground, but who ſhall trie the matter of this qualitie, the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, in whoſe continuall poſſeſſion this triall hath béene vntill now of late, that vnder colour of this Statute, it hath béene incroched vpon, as it may appeare by all the Titles of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, where there is any mencion of the Tythes of new broken vp ground, and the Decrées of the Lawgiuers in the ſame, betwéene the Monaſteries challenging them by graunt, and the Parochian Miniſters of the Pariſh where they grew, claiming the ſame by right: Or the Temporall Iudges, whoſe is the Cogniſaunce of the Tytle and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the ground, as alſo is the ſetting, letting, buying, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and other alienating of the ſame.</p>
            <p>For the point it ſelfe, the Statute maketh no mention, but paſſeth it ouer with ſilence; and therefore it is to bée preſumed that it meant, that it ſhould there reſt, where it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16472:100"/>
was before the making of the ſtatute: for the ſtatute was not made in derogation of the Eccleſiaſticall procéedings, that were before; but in affirmance thereof, as the whole drift of the ſaid Statute doth ſhew.</p>
            <p>And if the Statute had meant otherwiſe, it would ſurely haue expreſſed it either in the prouiſo it ſelfe, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the derogatorie clauſe; where it maketh an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of ſuch things as it intended ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the tryall of the Eccleſiaſticall Law, and by vertue of this Statute, ſhould not bee compriſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, among which there is no word of this prouiſo, or anie other in the ſame Statute before named.</p>
            <p>Neither is it vnto the purpoſe, that the Common Law of this Land taketh knowledge of the Tenure and Title of Lands, and ſuch other complements belonging to the ſame; for theſe things that are here in queſtion, are no part of thoſe Legall Eſſences, which the Law requireth to the Tytle and Tenure thereof, as is Féeſimple, féetaile, and other of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the learning of that Law, but theſe are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accidents ouer and beſide the Tenure of the land, which may be preſent or abſent without the iniurie of the Tytle: as God many times turneth floulds into wilderneſſe, &amp; ſprings of water againe into drineſſe, &amp; a fruitful land makes he bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for the wickedneſſe of them that dwel therin, and yet the Tytle or Tenure of the ground is not changed, by theſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of qualities, but remains the ſelfe ſame that it was: ſo that theſe things are no more ſubiect to the ordering of the Common Law, than it is in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law, to iudge &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what mould is white &amp; what is black: what ground will beare wheat, what barley, what oats; for theſe things are no matters of ſkil of law, that they néed to be fetcht out of bookes, but they are matters of common experience which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery country man can as well ſkill of as the greateſt Lawyer that is, and therefore the Law in this caſe is not deſirous of any curious proofe, but contenteth it ſelfe onely with the depoſitions of two or thrée honeſt men, which ſpeak ſenſibly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16472:101"/>
and féelingly to the point that is in hand, which is enough to direct any wiſe Iudge in his ſentence, ſo that it néeds not theſe long circumſtances of twelue men to teach the Iudge what and how truely the witneſſes haue depoſed. For if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery qualitie of the ground reſteth in the mouth of twelue men onely, then ſhould no man bee able to ſay out of the mouth of a witneſſe, and pronounce thereupon, this ground is mountaine, this is plaine, this is meadowe, this is errable, vnleſſe he were warranted by the verdit of twelue men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: which if it be an abſurditie to hold, then ſure it is like abſurd to ſay, that barren, heath, and waſte cannot bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced without a Iurie; for that theſe things are like obui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſence, and like qualited as the other are.</p>
            <p>And I pray you, when they haue drawne it vnto their triall, what doe they in effect otherwiſe than the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iudge would or ſhould haue done, if it had remained ſtil vnder him? for doe they giue credit ſimply to the conceit of the Iurie, as touching that which hath béene declared and pleaded in the cauſe before them, or doe not the Iudges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues rather make a briefe of all that hath béene pleaded in the cauſe before them, and thereof make as it were a verdit, and put the ſame in the mouth of the twelue for their verdit, before they goe from the bar? So that the whole weight of the cauſe ſtandeth rather in the Iudges direction, in ſuch ſort as it is at the Eccleſiaſticall Law, than it doth in the mouth of the Iurie; for the Iurie men for the moſt part, are ſimple people, &amp; ſcarce foure of the twelue vnderſtand their euidence: ſo that it may ſéeme rather to be a matter of ſuperſluitie than of good policie, to refer a matter to their verdit, when as they ſay no other thing, than that the Iudge taught them before; <hi>Stultum enim est id facere per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora:</hi> for albeit perhaps ſome capricious fellow of the Iurie, vpon the confidence of his owne braine, ſometimes ſtart aſide from that which the Iudge hath told him, and draw the reſt of his fellowes, as ſo many ſhéepe, after him; yet for the moſt part the Iudges voice is their direction, their loadſtone, and and North pole to guid them in this buſineſſe.</p>

Beſides, in this Prouiſo, as in ſome other precedent, there is a great diſaduantage offered to the Clergie, which they much complaine of, and that is, that in caſes of this nature, they are compelled to ſuffer triall vnder them, who are as in a maner parties vnto the ſuit, by reaſon of the intereſt they haue therein, either in preſent, or in conſequence; ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now a daies (learning too late by other mens harmes what the euent in theirowne cauſe wilbe) chuſe rather to looſe their right, than to venture their cauſe vpon ſuch partiall Iudges, as the 12. men are.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning thoſe prohibitions as are forced out of this Statute, for naturally they grow not out thereof: ſo that I might now paſſe ouer to the other branch of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, that is of ſuch matters as are now held by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyers, to be in a certaine meaſure only of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall procéeding, but were aunciently wholy of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cognuſance; but that the name of the Statute, <hi>De Sylua caedua,</hi> offering it ſelfe vnto me in the concluſion of this Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the vj. giues me occaſion to ſpeak ſomething thereof, before I come to the reſt.</p>
            <p>This Statute as the words thereof doe ſhew, was made in behalfe of the Laitie againſt the Clergie, for the exemption of great Woods of xx. yéeres growth, &amp; vpward, from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes; and that in three caſes only, where the wood was great, where it was of xx. yeares of age and vpward, where it was ſold to Marchants, eyther to the profit of the owner himſelfe, or in ayd of the King in his warres; ſo that without theſe caſes, it ſéemeth the Statute intended no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exemption: for Statutes are things of ſtrict Law, and are no further to be extended, than the words thereof giue matter thereunto, ſpecially when the thing it ſelfe naturally was lyable to ordinary courſe of the Law, as other things of like nature are, and the ſtatute comes in derogation of their ordinary courſe: as in this caſe, great timber auntient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was no leſſe tythable than ſmall trées are, and ſo by nature ought to be if the ſtatute were not to the contrary; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe limitations of the ſame, if great wood be

cut down to any other vſe then to ſale, as to build, or to burne to a mans owne vſe, a prohibition in this caſe lyeth, and yet is there no Identitie of reaſon to extend it, nor any abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie would follow, if it were not extended, for here is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mony ſought (which gaue occaſion vnto the Lawgiuers to make this ſtatut of exemption) neyther is it an vnnatural thing for to pay Tythes of great wood; for before this time they were paid, and by the Law of God it ſéemes they ought to be paied, for that he that is taught, ought to communicate to him that teacheth him in all things: and therefore ſince the reaſon that moued the Lawgiuers to order it ſo in one caſe, ceaſeth in the other, there is no reaſon of extention, &amp; when there is not an Identitie of reaſon, in the things that are in demaund, there can no ſound inference be brought in from the one to the other, for of ſeuerall things, there is a ſeuerall reaſon, and a ſeuerall conſequence, neyther can there be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereof a good implication, eyther poſitiuely, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely: neyther hath this interpretation of theirs any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Law for it, ſaue that it hath bin ſo defined and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but what is that to the purpoſe, if it hath bin wreſted and wronged contrary to the true ſence of the Statute, and that by thoſe that take benefit thereby, whoſe partiality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, the thing it ſelfe would eaſily turne againe to his owne nature, and right would take place?</p>
            <p>The reaſon they yéeld for the exemption of great woods of the ages aforeſaid, although to themſelues, it be plauſible, yet to others it is ſtrange, as namely, that great Trées are <note place="margin">Plowd. in Soby contra Molyns.</note> part of the Fréehold, and that men vſe not to pay Tythes of their fréehold, but of thoſe things which ſpring out of their fréehold, as out of Corne, graſſe, fruit, &amp; ſuch other; whereas in déed the talleſt Timber tree, that is, if it were as high as the higheſt Cedar in Lebanon, is no more part of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or fréehold, than the loweſt bramble that groweth in the field; for they are both equally part of the ground wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they grow, and do take a like noriſhment and ſuſtenance from the ſame, neyther doe they differ in that they are trées the one from the other, <hi>ſecundum magis et minus,</hi> as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16472:102"/>
ſay; but in that, the one is a great trée, and the other a ſmall ſhrub: and the cauſe of this prouiſion here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for theſe great trées, was not for that one was more of the inheritance than the other, but for that the one yéeldeth more profit to the common wealth, than the other, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue made the cutting down of the one more penal, than the other: as in like caſe by the Ciuile Law, who ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily cutteth downe, or barketh a vine, an oliue, or a fig trée, <note place="margin">ff.

In theſe Actions, he that ſued <hi>ad publicam vindictam,</hi> and had followed it ſo far, as that he had brought it to a Recantation, or a publicke diſgrace, could not haue recompence of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by money, ſaue onely in caſe of commutation: neither hee that had got his credit valued by money, could haue a publike diſgrace alſo inflicted for his ſatiſfaction, but what way he had choſen, with that he muſt haue reſted contented, for that irè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mens wraths otherwiſe would neuer haue bin ſatiſfied, &amp; the proſecution of theſe actions otherwiſe wold be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded.</p>
            <p>Theſe two kinds of procéedings the Princes and Sages of former ages ſeeme to haue ſorted to the two kindes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction that are amongſt vs, the one Spirituall, the other Temporall: and therefore the Law of the Land it ſelfe ſaith in a cauſe of Diffamation, when money is not demanded, but a thing done for puniſhment of ſin, which is all one, as when the Ciuilians ſay, when it is done <hi>ad publicam vindicta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> it ſhall be tried in the ſpiritual courts: wherupon by argument of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſenſe it followeth, that where the puniſhment of ſin is not required, but amends in money is demanded, there it is to be tried in the temporal Court, for the law would that euery man ſhould haue his remedy agréeable to reaſon in what ſort him beſt liketh. And therfore be the fault what it may be, that the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diffamation do ſound vnto, as long as it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds but in words, &amp; the party doth not take vpon him to iuſtifie the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16472:107"/>
matter that is compriſed vnder thoſe words, and doth ſéeke but for the puniſhment of the ſlanderous words only, ſo long it is to be tryed at the Spirituall Law; for the Law ſpeaketh in generall in caſes of Diffamation, where puniſhment of ſin only is required: ſo that where a man is called Traitor, Felon, or Murtherer, or any other crime belonging vnto the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law, being euery one of them words of great diffamation, ſo the partie therein ſéeke puniſhment onely, and not his priuat intereſt, there the Spiritual Law is to hold plea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For where the Law doth not diſtinguiſh, there neither ought we to diſtinguiſh; but the Law hath ſaid in general, that cauſes of Diffamation, whoſe proſecution is thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, doe belong vnto the triall of the ſpiritual Law: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen thoſe caſes before remembred where the party fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this kind of proſecution, ought by that Law to belong vnto the Spirituall court, as on the contrarie ſide, Spiritual cauſes of Diffamation being propounded to a pecuniarie end ought to be ordered in a Temporall Court.</p>
            <p>But where any man takes vpon him to iuſtifie the crime that he hath obiected, there either Court is to hold plea of the crime that properly belongeth to that Court, for that now no longer words are in queſtion, but matter is in tryal, whether the partie diffamed hath indéed committed that offence that he is charged withall or no; which can bee tried in no other Court, than in that to which it doth properly appertaine. And that this was the Courſe aunciently held in matters of diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation betwéene the Eccleſiaſticall and Common Law, it is manifeſt by the Statute of 2. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. chapter 11. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> where, although the Statute taxeth the peruerſe dealing of ſuch as when they had béene indicted before the Sherifes in their Retorne, &amp; after deliuered by Inqueſt before the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Aſſiſe, did ſue the indictors in the Spiritual Court, ſurmiſing againſt them that they had diffamed them, and therefore in that caſe forbad the like ſuits; for that Iuſtice thereby was hindered, and many people were feared to indict Offenders: yet that Statute plainly ſheweth that in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes of Diffamation riſing out of Temporall crimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16472:107"/>
this, the Eccleſiaſticall Law had the cogniſaunce: and that this was forbidden, it was not for that, that words of this nature, could not be cenſured at the Eccleſiaſticall Law, when puniſhment of ſin only is required, but for that it was not fit that thoſe things which had béene once ordered in one Court, ſhould be called againe to examination in another Court: and therefore the generall procéeding in matters of Diffamation, is not there prohibited, but the particuler croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of matters after iudgement is there reprehended.</p>
            <p>So that, that diſtinction I haue here before ſpoken of, which taketh vpon it to determine when a caſe of Diffamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the Temporal cogniſance, &amp; when of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, cannot here take place: for that it is contrarie to the former Statute or Decrée that diuided theſe caſes into Temporall or Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance by the varietie of the proſecution thereof, and that it is contrarie to the auncient practiſe that hath confirmed this proſecution in either Court, but ſpecially in the Eccleſiaſticall Court, which hath ſtill holden the triall of ſuch Diffamations wherein ſin hath béene onely ſought to be puniſhed, vntill now of late, that men haue ſtept ouer the bankes of their authoritie and confounded either Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the promiſcuous acts one of another; when as the Statute it ſelfe is plaine, that the authors of this Statute or Decrée, whetherſoeuer you call it, which ſet theſe bounds to either law, in procéeding vpon matters of Diffamation, reſpected not ſo much the qualitie of the crime, vpon which the Diffamation grew, as the manner of procéeding therein, ayming in the one at publicke vindict, which is to be ſought out of the Eccleſiaſticall law, and in the other at priuat inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is to be had out of the Temporall Law.</p>
            <p>Neither is an Action of Diffamation, a matter of ſo light eſteeme or qualitie (a mans fame or good name being in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ballance with his life) as that it ſhould be drawne away to be attendant on any other action that is of ſmaller weight or importance than it ſelfe is: for this is one of thoſe Actions which for the ſpeciall preheminence thereof, are called <hi>Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes praeindiciales,</hi> that is, ſuch that draw ſmaller cauſes vnto
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16472:108"/>
them, but themſelues are drawne of none other, but ſuch as are like principal or greater than themſelues are. So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the manner of procéeding bring theſe cauſes vnder the compaſſe of the common Law, in ſuch ſort as I haue before ſhewed the coopling of them with another matter of the ſame Law, will hardly bring them vnder the triall thereof: For that there be few actions greater than it ſelfe is, ſo that if the crime be Eccleſiaſticall, howſoeuer it toucheth a Temporall cauſe, the tryall ſhall be ſtill at the Eccleſiaſticall Law. And the ſame that I ſay of Diffamations riſing out of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall crimes, I hold alſo to bee true in Diffamations ſpringing out of Temporall crimes, where puniſhment is required for the offence committed, and amends in money is not demaunded, vnleſſe happely that grow of penance inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which the offender wil redéeme by giuing money to the Iudge, or to the party grieued. And this I take to be a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter limitation for either Law, hauing the ground of the Ciuil Law, and a ſtatute of the Common Law, and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelfe for it, than the other deuiſe is, which ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth this buſineſſe, as ſtill it makes it reſt in the mouth of the Iudge, which cauſe of Diffamation is méere ſpiritual, and which not, which were not to be done if there were cléere dealing in the matter: for Lawes are ſo to be made, as that as little as may be, bee left to the diſcretion of the Iudge, but all be expreſſed as far as the nature of the cauſe will giue leaue: which albeit it be hard to doe, for the varietie of the caſes that euery day happen, neuer thought on before, yet that is to be laboured ſo far as may be; for this libertie of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many things to the Iudges diſcretion, is many times great occaſion of confuſion in Iudicature, ſaying ſometimes this and ſometimes that, as his priuat humor ſhall lead him: and therefore a plaine diſtinction betwéene both the Lawes were beſt, that euery man may ſee and ſay what is proper to either of them.</p>
            <p>And thus far as concerning matters of Diffamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now followeth that I ſpeake of matters of Baſtardie.</p>
            <p>Baſtardie is an vnlawfull ſtate of birth diſabled by diuine

            <p>Of ſingle women ſome are ſuch as a man may make his wife, if himſelfe bee ſole and vnmarried, as thoſe that are kept as Concubines in place of a mans wife; ſome other are ſuch as a man cannot make his wife, although himſelfe bee ſole and vnmaried, for that either they are alreadie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracted to ſome other, or that they be in ſo néere a degrée of affinitie or conſanguinitie one to the other, that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage would bee damnable, and the iſſue thereof vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch as are begotten of ſingle women, by ſingle men, who are in caſe to marrie them if they will, ſome are called by the Ciuile Law <hi>Filij Naturales,</hi> becauſe they were begot by ſuch as they held for their wiues, and yet were not their wiues, who might be legitimat by ſundry waies, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Some other begot vpon ſingle women, if they were begot in vage luſt, without any purpoſe to hold ſuch a one for a Concubine, but vpon a deſire onely to ſatiſfie a mans preſent Luſt, whether they were begotten by married men or ſingle men were called <hi>Spurij,</hi> who for the moſt part are putatiue children, and their Father is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe knowne than by the mothers confeſſion, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaith true, ſometimes otherwiſe. <hi>Iſidor</hi> ſaith, they were ſo called becauſe they were borne out of puritie, for that ſuch kinde of luſt is contrarie to holy Matrimonie, whoſe bed is vndefiled, and therefore the other is corrupt and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
            <p>But where any was borne of a woman ſingle or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that proſtituted her ſelfe to euery mans pleaſure, and made publicke profeſſion of her ſelfe to be an harlot, ſuch as are they whom the Law calleth <hi>Scorta,</hi> theſe were called <hi>Manzeres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe which were begotten of maried women were cald <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi,</hi> becauſe they ſéemed to be his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage doth

ſhew, but are not, no otherwiſe than ſome feauers are called <hi>Nothae,</hi> that is, baſtard feauers, becauſe they immitate the tertian or quartan Feauer in heat and other accidents, but yet are neither tertians or quartans, as the learned Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wel know: but theſe are counted ſo to be baſtards, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the huſband were ſo long abſent from his wife, as by no poſſibilitie of Nature the child could be his; or that the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer and Adultereſſe were ſo knowne to kéepe company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as that by iuſt account of time, it could not fall out to be any other mans child but the Adulterers himſelfe: and yet in theſe very caſes within this Realme, vnleſſe the huſband bee all the time of the impoſſibilitie beyond the Seas, the Rule of the Law holds true, <hi>Pater is eſt quem nuptia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt nefarious and laſt kind of baſtards are they whom the Law calleth <hi>Inceſtuoſi,</hi> which are begot betwéene aſcendents and deſcendents <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and betwéen colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals, ſo far as the Diuine Prohibition and the right inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof doth ſtretch it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The effects of theſe ſorts of baſtardies are diuerſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it ſtaineth the bloud, for that he that is a baſtard can neither challenge Honour nor Armes from the Father or Mother, for that he was begot and borne out of Matrimonie which is the firſt ſtep to Honour: and therefore the Apoſtle calleth Marriage honorable, whereupon it muſt follow that the oppoſite thereof is ſhame; for, albeit it be no ſin for a baſtard to be a baſtard, yet is it a defect in him to be ſuch a one, and a thing eaſily ſubiect to reproch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it repelleth him that is a baſtard, from all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion deſcending from the Father or the mother, whether it be in goods or Lands, vnleſſe there be ſome other collaterall, prouiſion made for the ſame: for that all ſuch Lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes as are made to any of theſe purpoſes, were intended to the benefit of ſuch as are Legitimat, and are next of kin by lawfull ſucceſſion, and not by vnlawfull coniunction.</p>
            <p>To Legitimat him that was a baſtard, when there could no clame be made vnto his birthright but by grace, among
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16472:109"/>
the Romans were ſundry wayes; firſt where the Father of the Baſtard, they being both ſingle perſons, married the woman by whom he begot the child; ſecondly where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did by his laſt will and Teſtament, or by ſome publike inſtrument ſubſcribed by witneſſe, name him to be his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawfull ſonne, or ſimply his ſonne, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of theſe two words, baſe, or natural, &amp; therwithall did make him his heyre, which could not be, but in ſuch caſes only, where the father had no other naturall &amp; lawfull child left aliue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas the Prince by his reſcript, or the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by their decrée, did doe any one that credyt, as to grant them the fauor of legitimation, which was done for the moſt part in ſuch caſes only, wheras eyther the father of the child, or the child himſelfe, offered himſelfe to be attendant on the Court or Prince.</p>
            <p>In this Realme none of the foreſaid legitimations take place, as far as I can learne, but only that which is done by Parliament, and that verie rarely; for beſide thoſe that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. did in the varietie and mutabilitie of his mind, <note place="margin">28. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> towards his owne iſſue, I think there cannot be many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhewed: for, as for that which is wrought by ſubſequent <note place="margin">1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamen. cap.</hi> 1.</note> Marriage, being a thing auntiently preſſed by the Clergie of this Land, to be admytted in like ſort, as it is vſed in other Lands, where the Eccleſiaſtical Law taketh place; it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the Earles and Barons with one voice, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere made that they would not change the Lawes of the Realme in that point, which to that time had bin vſed and approued. All theſe caſes of Baſtardie in other Lands, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſuch, or not ſuch, are triable by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law; But here with vs it is queſtionable to what Law, and how far they doe appertaine, the Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall.</p>
            <p>For the matter of Baſtardie, what it is, the Eccleſiaſticall Law, &amp; the Temporall differ not, but there is a diuerſitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them in the proſecution therof, for the Eccleſiaſticall Law bringeth it two waies in Iudgement; the one incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16472:110"/>
the other principally, but the Common Law maketh two ſorts thereof the one generall, the other ſpeciall: But firſt of the Eccleſiaſticall diuiſion, then of the temporall.</p>
            <p>Baſtardie is then ſaid to be incidently propounded, when it is laied in bar of ſome other thing, that is principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſed; as when one ſueth for an inheritance that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth is due vnto him by his natiuitie, an other croſſeth him therein, by obiecting againſt him baſtardie, with purpoſe to exclude him from his action in the inheritance: here the barre is in the incident, becauſe it comes excluſiuely to the action of inheritance, but the action for the inheritance it ſelfe was in the principall, for that it was begun in conſideration of the inheritance, and not with intent to proue himſelfe legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate; which happilie he neuer dreamed of when he firſt entered his action for the inheritance. In which caſe he which is charged with the baſtardie, may require himſelfe to be admitted to proue himſelfe legitimate, before the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Iudge, &amp; to be pronounced to be ſuch a one, <hi>Ad Curiam enim Regiam non pertinet agnoſcere de Baſtardia:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Glanuill Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> Againſt which the Law of the Land doth not oppoſe it ſelfe, but acknowledge it to be the right of the Church. And yet to auoid all ſubtil &amp; ſurrepticious dealing in this behalf, it hath <note place="margin">9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11</note> ſet downe a wary and cautelous forme of procéeding, by which the ſame ſhall be brought vnto the Ordinary, &amp; ſuch as haue intereſt in the ſuit, may haue notice therof, and time to obiect in forme of Law againſt the proofes and witneſſes of him that pretends himſelfe to be <hi>Mulier,</hi> if they ſo think good: and what ſhall be certified herein by the Ordinarie, as concerning the natiuitie of him that is burthened to be a Baſtard, (that is, whither he were borne before or after his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Glanuill Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> Parents marriage) ſhall be ſupplied in the kings Court, eyther by Iudging for, or againſt the inheritance.</p>
            <p>But Baſtardie is then taken to be principally propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when eyther one finding himſelfe to be gréeued with ſome malicious ſpéech of his aduerſary reproching him with baſtardy, or himſelf fearing to be impeched in his good name, or right, doth take a courſe to cléere his natiuitie, by calling
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16472:110"/>
into the law, him or them by whom he is reproched, or feareth to be impeached in his right and credit, to ſee him, to prooue himſelf legitimate, &amp; to alleage &amp; obiect againſt it, if they oght haue, or can, to the contrarie: which if eyther they doe not, or doing to the vtmoſt what they can, can bring no good matter againſt his proofe, but that it ſtands ſtill good and effectuall in Law to all intents &amp; purpoſes whatſoeuer (although perhaps hereby he ſhall not be able to carry the inheritance, both for that it apperteineth not to the Eccleſiaſticall Law, to Iudge of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, &amp; alſo for that there is a preciſe forme ſet downe by ſtatute, how ſuits of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be recouered) yet if no oppoſitor or contradictor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare herein, &amp; the ſuit was only taken in hand againſt ſuch, as eyther openly reproched him, or ſecretly buzzed abroad ſlanderous ſpéeches, as concerning his legitimation: it is not to be doubted, but by an accident alſo it wil be good for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance it ſelfe, for where a mans legitimation, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prooued, thereon followeth all things which naturally thereto belong. But if any man vrge the forme of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <note place="margin">9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> being intereſſed therein, then muſt it neceſſarily be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for that otherwiſe it would be thought, all that was done before, ſo far as it may concerne the inheritance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were but in a conſequence, were done by colluſion. This kind of procéeding hath bin much more in vſe in former times than it is now, &amp; neuer any oppoſition made againſt it: but now it goeth not altogether cléer without contradiction, as many other things are offenſiuely taken, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding haue good ground, &amp; ſufficient warrant for them.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning the Eccleſiaſticall procéedings in this buſineſſe: Now to the temporall ſorts of them.</p>
            <p>Generall Baſtardie is ſo called, becauſe it comes in inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and is in groſſe obiected againſt ſome that ſueth in a matter principall, to diſappoint his ſuit. This ſuit becauſe it is of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance, it is ſent by the Kings writ to the Ordinary with certeine additions for more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitie of the inquirie thereof; as that whether he that is charged with the Baſtardie, were borne in lawfull Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16472:111"/>
or out of Matrimonie, or whether he were borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father &amp; Mother were lawfully contracted together in Matrimonie, or after. All which the Ordinarie makes <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. Intrac. fol.</hi> 35.</note> inquirie vpon by his owne ordinarie and paſtorall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for that matters of Baſtardie doe originally belong to the Eccleſiaſticall Court, and not to the Temporall Court: And as he findes the trueth of the matter by due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be thus, or that, ſo he pronounceth for the ſame in his owne Conſiſtorie, and makes certificat thereupon to the kings Court accordingly; and as he pronounceth, ſo the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Iudges follow his ſentence in their Iudgements, eyther for or againſt the inheritance that is in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Speciall Baſtardy they ſay is that, where the Matrimony <note place="margin">Bracton.</note> is confeſſed, but the prioritie or poſterioritie of the Natiuitie of him whoſe byrth is in queſtion, is controuerſed; which to my thinking, if I conceiue aright, is no other thing than the generall baſtardie, tranſpoſed in words, but agreeing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance &amp; matter with the other: for euen theſe things which they pretend, make ſpeciall Baſtardie, are parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the generall baſtardie, and are eyther confeſſed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired vpon by vertue of the Kings writ in the ſame: For firſt for the Matrimonie that is here mentioned, it is there agniſed both by the plaintife in pleading of it, and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the anſwering thereto, &amp; therefore the plaintifes plea is thus; thou art a baſtard, for that thou waſt borne before thy parents were lawfully contracted together in Marriage, or before theyr marriage was ſolemnized in the face of the Church; to which the defendants replie is, I am no baſtard for that I was borne in lawfull matrimony, or that I was borne after that my father and mother were lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together, in both which you ſée, there is a mariage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, &amp; the queſtion onely is of the priority or poſteriority of the natiuitie of him that is charged withall, whither it hapned before, or after his parents marriage, which as they hold is the other member of ſpeciall baſtardie: and yet this prioritie or poſterioritie of natiuitie, by vertue of the Kings writ, comes no leſſe in inquirie to the Ordinary in the caſe of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16472:111"/>
the generall baſtardie, than they make it to be trauerſable in the ſpeciall baſtardie; and therfore the writ to the Ordinary for generall baſtardie is conceiued in this manner. <hi>viz. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiratis</hi>

But to ſay the truth, if theſe things be well weyghed and conſidered, ſpeciall Baſtardy is nothing elſe, but the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the generall, and the generall againe is nothing but the definite of the ſpeciall: for whoſoeuer is borne out, or before lawfull Matrimonie, he is a baſtard, and he againe is a baſtard that is borne before or out of lawful matrimony, ſo that theſe things to be a baſtard, and to be borne out of lawfull matrimony are conuertible one with the other: ſo then as it were very hard to make a diuorce betwéene theſe things that are ſo néere in nature one to the other, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertible termes one to the other, ſo hard again it were in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to diſioyne theſe things in triall, that are ſo neere in affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie one to the other, becauſe they are the ſame in ſubſtance &amp; nature as the other are, and therfore <hi>eodem iure cenſeri de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,</hi>

A certaine man of Norwich Dioceſſe called R. H. had iſſue <note place="margin">Ca. Lator. ext. qui filij ſunt legitimi.</note> I. H. who had a ſonne called C. H. I. H. deceaſing before R.

H. was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, draweth the ſaid C. H. into the Temporall Court vpon the inheritance, whereupon C. H. called the ſaid M. H. into the Biſhop of Norwich his Court, for the triall of his natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but the Biſhop long protracting the cauſe, C. H. appealed to the Pope, who delegated the ſame cauſe to the Biſhop of Exceſter, and the Abbot of Hereforde, with order, That if the ſaid M. H. ſhould not within two Monethes, prooue that which he obiected againſt C.

Which preſident though it be long before the Statute of Baſtardie made by <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and ſo no writ went from the temporall Court for the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat therof: yet it ſhewes that the Temporall Iudges in thoſe daies did not procéed to iudgement in the principall cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the incident were decided by the Ordinary; &amp; that they counted baſtardy then to be of the Eccleſiaſt. cogniſance; and that it was lawful for him that was prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be a baſtard, to appeal from his Ordinary, if either the Ordinary detracted the determination therof, or were ſuſpected of parciality.</p>
            <p>And thus far of the incident. There is an other much like precedent to this in the ſame Kings dayes, but that is in the principall, for that the inheritance came not firſt in queſtion, but the legitimation it ſelfe, and the caſe is as followeth.

poſſeſſion of all the goods &amp; lands he had of the ſaid Raphe his grandfather, for that he did pretend the ſaid Agatha his niece &amp; Mother of the ſaid Richard was not borne of lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, ſo that neither ſhée her ſelfe, nor her ſonne ought to ſuccéed the brother of the ſaid Frauncis, but that the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof did belong vnto himſelfe: whereupon the ſaid Richard being thus ſpoiled by Frauncis his great vncle, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained letters of reſtitution to the Biſhop of London, the B. of Worceſter, &amp; the B. of Exceſter, vnder this forme; That before they entred into the principall cauſe, which was this, whether the ſaid Agatha were borne in lawfull Matrimonie or not, they ſhould reſtore the ſaid Richard to his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritance. But the Biſhop of Rome after vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the ſaid Delegats, that the plea of inheritance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realme, did not belong vnto the Church, but vnto the King, recald that part of his reſcript, which concerned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſaid Richard to his inheritance, &amp; gaue order to the foreſaid Biſhops, to procéed in the cauſe of legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; willing them to inquire whether the ſaid Agatha were borne of the ſaid Aneline in the life time of her huſband Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and when ſhée dwelt &amp; cohabited with him, as with her huſband, or whether the ſaid Raphe, father of the ſaid Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, kept the ſaid Aneline openly &amp; publikely, while the ſaid Allin yet liued; And if they found it to be ſo, then they ſhould pronounce her the ſaid Agatha to be a Baſtard, for that Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line her Mother could not be counted to be a wife, but a whore, which defyling her huſbands bed, preſumed to kéep company with an other, her huſband yet being aliue: But if they found it otherwiſe, then they ſhould pronounce her the ſaid Agatha to be legitimate. All which was done after the death of the ſaid Raph and Aneline, as the Decretall it ſelfe ſhewes: Neyther was there any authoritie that oppoſed it ſelfe againſt that procéeding, but held it to be good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though it were in tearmes of ſpeciall Baſtardy, for then that which they now call ſpeciall Baſtardy, was not borne. Beſides hereby it appeareth, that the Ordinaries then did not only procéed in caſes of Baſtardy incidently, that is, when

Now it followeth that I ſhew wherin the Eccleſiaſtical law may be relieued, &amp; ſo both the laws know their own bounds, and not one to ouerbeare the other as they doe at this day, to the great veration of the ſubiect, and the intollerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of them both, which is the laſt part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The meanes therefore to relieue the profeſſion of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile Law are two. The firſt is, by the reſtoring of thoſe things which haue bin powerfully by the Common Law, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, &amp; the bringing of them back againe vnto their old and wonted courſe: The other is by allowing them the practiſe of ſuch things as are grieuances in the Common wealth, and fit to be reformed by ſome court, but yet are by no home-Law prouided for.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe ſtands in two things, whereof the one is the right interpretation of thoſe Lawes, ſtatutes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes which are written and deuiſed in the behalfe of the Eccleſiaſticall Law. The other conſiſteth in the correcting and ſupplying of ſuch Lawes and Statutes that are either ſuperfluous or defectiue in the penning, made in the behalfe (as it is pretended) of the Eccleſiaſticall profeſſion, but yet by reaſon of the vnperfect penning thereof, are conſtrued for the moſt part, againſt them.</p>
            <p>The right interpretation of the Lawes, Statutes, and Cuſtomes pertaining to the practiſe, ſtandeth as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Iudges mouth, who notwithſtanding hath that authoritie from the Soueraigne, and that not to iudge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as him beſt liketh, but according as the right of the cauſe doth require.</p>

            <p>Lawes, Statuts, or Cuſtomes, are then beſt interpreted whenas the verie plaine and naturall ſence of them is ſo ſought after, and no forraine or ſtrained expoſition is mixt with them; for that turneth Iuſtice into wormewood, and Iudgement into gall: then that the Iudge be no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſubtill in his interpretation, but follow ſuch expoſition of the Laws, as men of former age haue vſed to make, if they be not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſurd and erronious, for oft ſhifting of interpretations bréedeth great variance in mens ſtates, among ſuch as haue buſie heads, &amp; much diſcrediteth the Law it ſelfe, as though there were no certainty in it: with which although the ſage Iudges of our time cannot bee charged, for oght that I know, yet (I cannot tell how) men much complaine that lawes are far otherwiſe conſtrued in theſe daies than they were in former ages: which as it is an ordinarie complaint in the Temporall Courts, ſo it is not without cauſe, much lamented at in the ſpirituall Courts where the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the thrée Statutes of Tiths made by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eight, and <hi>Edward</hi> his ſon, among ſundry other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancies of other Lawes, hath ſuch great varietie of ſence and vnderſtanding in ſundry points thereof, as that if the makers thereof were now aliue and the firſt expoſitors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſate in place of Iudgement againe (the Statutes being meaſured by the interpretation they now make of them) would hardly acknowledge them either to bee the Statuts that they made, or the other did after expound, and declare: for euery of theſe Statutes, and the ſence that was giuen of them, was wholy for the benefit of the Church, according to the tenor thereof, but as they now receiue explication, they are not onely not beneficiall vnto the Church, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hynderance to the ſame that may be; for the words are made to iar with the ſence, and the ſence with the words, neither is there kept any right analogie in them: and therefore the Reuerend Iudges are to be intreated (becauſe

            <p>And let this ſuffice for the right interpretation of Lawes and Statuts: now it followeth that I ſpeake ſomething of the ſupplies that may be made to the defects that are in the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but it was the full minde &amp; intent of the Law-makers, which made thoſe thrée Statutes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe the Eccleſiaſtical Courts in the inheritance of all thoſe cauſes that are compriſed in thoſe Statutes, ſaue thoſe that are by ſpeciall name exempted, and did by the ſaid Statute, as it were deliuer vnto them full and quiet poſſeſſion of the ſame, for euen ſo ſundry braunches of the ſaid Statute doe ſhew, as I haue elſwhere made it manifeſt: and that there hath growne queſtion vpon many points thereof, and that the profeſſors of the Eccleſiaſticall law haue béene inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the quiet poſſeſſion thereof, commeth of the vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect penning of the ſame, and not of any iuſt title or claime that may be made by the porfeſſors of the other Law therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but this is a thing not only proper to theſe thrée Statuts, but alſo Common to all other Statutes which are writ of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eccleſiaſticall cauſes within this Land; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be remedied, if it ſéem good vnto his ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie &amp; the reſt of the wiſdom of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land aſſembled together at any time for the making of wholſome Lawes and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the ſame, by ſupply of a few words in ſome places or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16472:115"/>
periods that are defectiue, and yet kéeping the true meaning and ſenſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As for example in the ſtatute of the two and thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight in the § wherefore, néere the beginning of the ſame Statute, the Statute ordering, that all perſons of this Realme and other of the Kings Dominions ſhall truely and effectually ſet out and pay all and ſinguler Tythes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawfull cuſtomes and vſages of the Pariſhes where they grow and become due: becauſe there is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made where theſe cuſtomes and vſages ſhall bee tried in the Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall Law; if theſe or the like words had beene added to the ſame (to be prooued before an Eccleſiaſtical Iudge after the form of the Eccleſiaſtical Law, &amp; not elſwhere) the whole matter had bin cleere for that point.</p>
            <p>And whereas againe in the end of the ſame Statute, there be ſome good words tending to the appropriating of theſe matters of Tythes and Oblations and other Eccleſiaſticall duties to the Eccleſiaſticall Courts; as that the remedie for them ſhall be had in the Spirituall Court according to the ordinance of the firſt part of that Act, and not otherwiſe: yet becauſe there is no penaltie to that act, buſie men eaſily make a breach thereinto, for that Lawes without penalties, for the moſt part are weake and of no force: if therefore this or the like ſupply were made (if any man ſue for theſe or like duties in any other Court, than in the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Court, the partie ſo ſuing, to forſeit the treble value of that which he ſued for to be recouered in the kings Eccleſiaſticall Court, where it ought to haue beene commenced by the way of Libell, or Articles, the one halfe therof ſhalbe to the king, the other to the partie grieued) many of theſe ſuits would eaſily be met withall. Neither is it to the purpoſe, that this is matter of mony and Lay fee that ſhould be in this ſort for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and therefore is not Regularly to bee ſued for in the Eccleſiaſticall Court; yet becauſe the cauſe is Eccleſiaſtical, vpon which the matter of forfaiture ariſeth, it may bee verie well allowed, <hi>Ne continentiae cauſarum diuidantur:</hi> and for that ordinarily euery Iuriſdiction that is wronged, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16472:116"/>
it ſelfe with a penaltie: beſide, we do by the like right in the Eccleſiaſticall courts, recouer expenſes of ſuits in Law, fées of Aduocats and, procters and money for redemption of ſin, ſo that it will be no ſtrange matter to haue this kind of ſuit allowed vnto the Eccleſiaſticall Court.</p>
            <p>Further, whereas there are in the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, chapter 13. in the beginning almoſt of the ſaid Statute, two clauſes vnder paine of for faiture, one of treble value, for Tythes carried away before they were diuided, ſet out or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for: The other of double value where the Tythes were hurt or impaired by the partie ſtopping or letting him that had intereſt therunto to carrie them away, or by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or carrying them away himſelfe; and the ſame, is ordered by a clauſe in the ſecond braunch thereof reaching vnto them both, for that a clauſe put in the end of two ſentences, ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it ſelfe indifferently vnto them both, if there be no more reaſon it ſhould belong to the one than the other, as there is not in this caſe (for if it were not ſo, the firſt penaltie had no order ſet downe, how it might be recouered) that the ſame ſhall be recouered according to the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Law: to which if there were added this word (onely, and not elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or otherwiſe) and they martialed in their right places there were nothing more ſure or ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whereas in the firſt prouiſo of that Statut it is decréed, that none ſhall be compelled to pay any manner of Tythes for any Here ditaments which by the Laws or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realme, or by any Priuiledge, Preſcription, or compoſition Reall, are not chargeable therewithall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is doubtfull in what Court the ſaid Exemptions are to be alleaged: if there were inſerted theſe words, or other of like nature (the ſaid Lawes, Statutes, Priuiledges, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, or Compoſitions Real to be alledged, argued, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed, and determined before the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the forme of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, and not elſwhere) vpon like for faiture of treble damages, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, it would make this point ſure vnto the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:16472:116"/>
Ouer and beſide this, whereas in the ſame ſtatute there is a diſcharge allowed to barren, heath, &amp; waſt ground, in ſome for not paiment of tithes, in other for the manner of paiment of them for the ſpace of ſeauen yeares after the improuing and conuerting of them into Arrable ground or meadowe; it would make the matter plaine, which lawe ſhoulde haue the pronouncing thereupon, if there were added theſe or the like wordes (ſo the ſame ground be proued in forme of law in the Eccleſiaſticall Court to be barren heath and waſt.)</p>
            <p>Laſtly wheras in the ſaid Statut among other limitations of cauſes wherin the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge is not to deale by vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid ſtatut, there is one in theſe words, néer the end of the ſaid ſtatut (ne in any matter wherof the Kings Court of right ought to haue Iuriſdiction) which limitation is ſo vage &amp; large, that therout there may be forged as many diuers kinds of Prohibitions, as the Poets fained <hi>Vulcan</hi> euer made thunderboults for <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And therfore it were very wel &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant to the good meaning of the ſaid ſtatut, this vagenes were reſtrained &amp; reduced to a more certainty of matter by theſe or like words, By any antient law or ſtatut of this land.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning the imperfection of the ſaid three Statuts, and how they may be amended and made reducible to the firſt meaning and intent of the makers therof, by ſome ſmale ſupplie, alteration, or change of wordes, the ſence and ground-work ſtanding euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, according to the wiſdom of his Maieſtie &amp; his great counſel aſſembled in parliament.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth I ſhewe wherein the practiſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Law, vnder which I compriſe the Ciuile Lawe ſo far as it is in vſe among vs, may be increaſed to the benefit of the ſubiect &amp; the inlargement of the profeſſion without the preiudice of the common law.

leaue to Tutors and Curators to ſell away al the gold, ſiluer, precious ſtone, apparrell, and other rich moueables the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator had, and to bring the ſame into money, which turned greatly to the hinderance of many Orphans: whereupon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> after he had firſt ordered, nothing ſhould bee ſold of the pearl, precious ſtone, naperie, vtenſels of the houſe and other neceſſarie ſtuffe and ornaments of the ſame, ſaith thus. Neither ſhall it be lawfull for them (meaning the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Curators) to ſell the houſe wherein the Father died, and the child grew vp, wherein it is woe enough to the child not to ſée his aunceſtors images not faſtened vp, or els puld downe. Therefore let the houſe, and all other his moueable goods ſtill remaine in the Patrimonie of the child, neither let any edifices or buildings, which came in good reparation with the inheritance, ruine or decay by colluſion of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: but rather if the Father, or he whoſoeuer the minor was heire vnto, left any building in decay, let the Tutor both by the Teſtimonie of the worke it ſelfe, and the faith of many be compelled to repaire it: for ſo the yearely rent will bring in more profit to the Minor, than the price of the things being deceiptfully ſold vnder-foot, will doe the Minor any good. Neither doth this law only make prouiſion againſt Tutors, but alſo againſt immodeſt and intemperate women, which many times gage vnto their new married huſbands, not only their owne ſtate, but euen the ſtate and liues of their children. Further, it croſſeth the courſe of putting the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens money to vſurie (notwithſtanding aunciently it was thought, therein conſiſted all the ſtrength of the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) for that courſe is ſeldome long, ſcarcely continuall and ſtable, and that therby many times the money being loſt the childrens ſtate come to nothing: and therfore his concluſion is, The Tutor ſhould ſell nothing, without the order of the Iudge, ſauing the Teſtators ouerworne apparrell, or thoſe things which by kéeping could not be kept from corruption, and ſuch cattell as were ſuperfluous.

            <p>I find an old practiſe aunciently vſed in the Eccleſiaſticall courts, for reſtraining Executors or Adminiſtrators for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling couenouſly alone in an Executorſhip or Adminiſtrator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when there are more Executors named in a Will than one, or more Adminiſtrators deputed by the Ordinarie in an Adminiſtration than one, which were well if it were recald &amp; brought back to his former vſe againe. For now, as things ſtand many times one capricious fellow named an Executor in a Wil, or appointed Adminiſtrator by the Ordinary with ſome other wel meaning men, getting a ſtart in this buſineſſe of the reſt, ingroſſeth all into his owne hands, and without priuitie or concurrence of the other, ſelleth, releaſeth, &amp; diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all at his owne pleaſure, contrarie to the mind either of the Teſtator, or the Ordinarie, who would not haue named ſo many in the Wil or Adminiſtration, but to the intent that all might or ſhould execute and adminiſter, &amp; one communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their acts with another. The contrarie whereof is many times very preiudiciall and hurtfull, to thoſe that are to take benefit by the ſaid Wil or Adminiſtration, who for the want of the due performance of this kind of procéeding, are defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all that which in right or reaſon ſhould haue come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, either by the Teſtators good-will, or by the benefit of the Law. And yet there is no remedie for this in law, ſo far as I know, for that al theſe making but one perſon in law, the Law yéelds no action to the one to ſue the other: but yet the ancient practiſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Law hath remedy, which would redreſſe all this miſchiefe, if it were cald againe to vſe, &amp; might go without controlment, as the equitie of the cauſe doth require. And the remedie is this, that ſuch other of the Executors or Adminiſtrators as are in this ſort interuerted from the execution of the Wil or Adminiſtration by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16472:120"/>
of any like Executor or Adminiſtrator, ſhould craue the aſſiſtance of the Iudge, &amp; will him by vertue of his office, to call in ſuch practick Executor or Adminiſtrator, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him vnder paine of excommunication, he procéed no further in the ſole execution therof, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat all his acts &amp; dealings with the reſt of his Coexecutors or Coadminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: which if it were ſo ordered, would make many mens Wils &amp; Adminiſtrations better performed than they are, &amp; a great ſort of poore Orphans ſtates more ſure &amp; certaine, than co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they are in ſuch executors or adminiſtrators hands.</p>
            <p>And certainly in this caſe, there is ſome good vſe of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſors in dead mens Wils (whom many men merily ieſt at, calling them candle-holders, as though they could do nothing elſe in the execution therof, but hold the candle while the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors tel the Defuncts money) if they might be permitted to put in practiſe that authoritie which the Law giueth them, and that is when they find any Executor deale fraudulently in the execution of any Teſtators Will, wherin they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuperuiſors, or do ingroſſe all the ſtate of the Defunct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, as hath bin before ſaid, they cal him to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that it may be ſéen how the adminiſtration ſtands, &amp; ech executor may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat to other their particuler receits &amp; diſburſments: which if any ſhal refuſe to do, then may the ſuperuiſor make therof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint vnto the Iudge, as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

For neither the Teſtator himſelfe, if hee were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue <note place="margin">Inſtit. de ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis tutorib. vel curator. toto tit.</note> againe, would indure him in this caſe, but would blot his name out of his Will, neither ought the Iudge to ſuffer

him, whoſe care is to ſée that dead mens Wils take their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, according to the Teſtators meaning. All which, the law hath prouiſion for, and for infinit things elſe of like good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in theſe caſes, if they might be ſuffered to put them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution without impeachment.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as concerning thoſe things wherein the Ciuile and the Eccleſiaſticall Law might be relieued without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to the common Law, for becauſe they haue no practiſe thereof: and yet doe not I bring forth theſe as the onely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wherein the Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall Law may be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to deale in, ouer and beſides the practiſe of thoſe things that they haue alreadie, but that theſe are few among many other which might be ſorted out, if ſo be there were any hope for the further enlargement of the profeſſion. But now to the neceſſitie of the maintenance of the ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall Law in this Realme, as they are now practiſed or ought to be practiſed, which was a thing firſt propounded, but laſt put in execution in this worke.</p>

            <p>Secondly, no man is ignorant of this, but in politicke gouernment two things ſway the whole ſtate, the one is peace at home, and the other is war abroad: which as they haue their ſeaſons, ſo they haue their cauſes and effects, the one from councell at home, the other from diſcipline abroad; neither can the one or the other of theſe be maintained, but by their priuate and proper Lawes.</p>
            <p>Beſide, in peace who ſéeth not, there is as much néed of vent by ſea, for to benefit the common wealth by, either by importation of thoſe things that wee want at home, or by exportation of thoſe things that we abound with; as there is prouiſion to be made for the increaſing and preſeruing of thoſe things that we haue riſing and growing by land in our owne contrey, neither of which can be had or inioyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their proper lawes fit and appertaining to either policie.

            <p>In matters that appertaine to the ſouls-health, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher teacheth out of the word of God, wherein the right ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God ſtandeth; he miniſtreth the Sacraments vnto the people, and inſtructeth them in other fundamental points of Religion: but it is the Eccleſiaſticall Law that compelleth men to the due obſeruance hereof, and puniſheth the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
            <p>All men grant, that there is a prouiſion to be made for the miniſter, for that it is againſt reaſon that any man ſhould go to warfare on his charges: but it is the Law of the Church that ſets out this prouiſion, and yeeldeth remedie for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie thereof, if it be denied.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more due vnto the dead, that that their laſt Wils ſhould be obſerued; for that it is ſuch an ordinance as a man hath not in his power againe, when God hath once cald him hence, neither is there any thing that Princes haue more graciouſly granted vnto their ſubiects, than that in their life time they may diſpoſe of that, which after they are dead, is none of theirs; and yet ſhall take place when they are not, as though yet they were theirs: in which prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ciuile and the Eccleſiaſtical Law, are aboue all other Lawes moſt Religious.</p>
            <p>Chriſtening, Wedding, Burying, wherby a man entreth into this world, conuerſeth in the world, and returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto the earth from whence he was taken, and ſo after paſſeth to glorie, and euerlaſting bliſſe, are euery one of the Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance.</p>
            <p>How many men of great ſkill, ſuch as few Princes haue greater in all kind of learning, are of this ranke, not only in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16472:122"/>
the ſocietie of them that profeſſe this knowledge here in the chiefeſt citie of the Land, but alſo in both the vniuerſities and in ſundry other parts of this Realm not ſtrangers, or forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but home-borne ſubiects of the ſame ſaith, of the ſame Religion, of the ſame kindred, and familie, of like allegeance to the Prince, and ſeruice to the common wealth, as other his good ſubiects are, euen thoſe that oppugne this profeſſion chiefly? whoſe practiſe, if it be ouerthrowne, or prouiſion leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, not onely thoſe that are now preſent, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this knowledge ſhall be faine to turne their copie, but thoſe that are futurely to come, wil change their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they ſée there is no reward or eſtimation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto: for it is Honour that nouriſheth Arts, and no man will follow that profeſſion that is out of count, and credit; but euery Father will ſay vnto his ſon in like ſort as <hi>Ouids</hi> Father ſaid to him, when hée ſaw him addict and giue himſelfe wholy to Poetrie, <hi>Studium quid inutile tentas?</hi> It was aunciently ſaid of the profeſſion of theſe Lawes, <hi>Dat Iuſtinianus honores;</hi> but now it is ſo far off from that, that it confers Honours, as that it is almoſt a diſcredit for any man to bee a Ciuilian in this State, and the profeſſion thereof doth ſcarce kéepe beggerie from the gate.</p>
            <p>As God doth diſpoſe his gouernment by Iuſtice and mercie (wherof notwithſtanding mercie hath the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame place in the Lords Tabernacle, as that which was put aboue vpon the Arke, wherin were the two Tables <note place="margin">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16472:123"/>
fit for their ſkil and education to manage the ſame, that is, to the ſeat of Iuſtice, the profeſſors of the Law of this Land, who may be thought beſt to know the Iuſtice of the ſame: but to the other they haue aſſigned the profeſſors of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile law, for that a great ſort of titles of that law, are titles of equitie, as whatſoeuer is <hi>Ius praetorium,</hi> or <hi>Ius adilicium,</hi> with them is matter of equitie; ſo that they might ſéeme beſt able for their ſkill in theſe tytles (of which no other Law hath the like) to aſſiſt the Lord Chancellor in matters of conſcience. Who though he be a man, for the moſt part, choſen by the Prince himſelfe, out of the reſt of the Sages of this Land, for his ſpeciall good parts of learning and integritie aboue the reſt (as now the Honorable perſon is that occupieth that place, who is as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of that eloquent Orator <hi>Marcus Craſſus, non vnus ex multis, ſed vnus inter omnes prope ſingularis)</hi> ſo that they might be thought for their great and eminent wiſdome in all things appertaining to their place, able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelues; yet becauſe it is, <hi>Diuinitatis potius qudm hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatis, omnium rerum habere memoriam, &amp; in nullo errare,</hi> as one well ſaith, It was prouidently done by Princes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, to ioyne to theſe great perſonages, men furniſhed with knowledge in theſe caſes of conſcience; wherein if they ſhould at any time ſtick, they might be aduiſed by them that are aſſeſſors with them, what they find in the Law proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the caſe in hand, that thereto they might ſquare their decrée, or order accordingly; whoſe varietie in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is ſuch, that hardly there can fall out any caſe in practiſe, but there will be ſome law, in that learning, conformable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: which opportunitie of men furniſhed with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for that ſeat, his Maieſtie ſhall want, vnleſſe the ſtudy of the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſticall Law be maintained, which alſo for the caſes of equitie and conſcience therein, is called of the old writers, <hi>Aequitas Canonica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what reaſon gaue occaſion to the precedent Princes to place men indowed with the ſkill of the Ciuile Law, in the court of Chancerie, the ſame alſo miniſtred to them minds to commit vnto the ſelfe ſame men, the ordering of their Courts
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16472:123"/>
of Requeſts: for that therein, for the moſt part, are handled poore miſerable perſons cauſes, as Widowes and Orphans, and other diſtreſſed people, whoſe caſes wholly rely on pietie and conſcience, as a fit ſubiect for that Law to deal in; which alſo will take a maime, if the ſtudie of the Ciuile Law bee not vpholden.</p>
            <p>So then, to deny a frée courſe to the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law in this Land, in ſuch things as appertaine to their profeſſion, or to abridge the maintenance thereof, is to ſpoile his Maieſtie of a part of his Honour (whoſe glorie it is to be furniſhed with all ſort of profeſſions neceſſarie for his ſtate, and beneficiall for his ſubiect) to weaken the ſtate publicke, and to bereaue it of graue and fage men, to aduiſe the State in matters of doubt and controuerſie betwéene forraine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and themſelues, to diſarme the Church of her faithfull friends and followers, and ſo to cut the ſinewes (as much as in them lyeth) of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and to expoſe her to the téeth of thoſe, who for theſe many yeares haue ſought to deuour her vp: and ſo now would do it, if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull prouidence of God, and the gracious eye of the Prince did not watch ouer her.</p>
            <p>And ſo far of the neceſſitie of theſe two profeſſions, and generally of the vſe and diſuſe of the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law in this Land, and wherein it is ouerlaid by the Common Law, and how it may be relieued, if it ſeeme good vnto his Maieſtie, and the wiſdome of this Realme. All which I haue written not of any purpoſe to derogate from the credit of that Law, vnder which I was borne, and by which I hold that ſmall maintenance that I haue: for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence it as a neceſſarie Law for this ſtate, and make ſuch reckoning of euerie of the profeſſors in his place, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth me: but that it pitieth me, and not only me, but all thoſe that tender good learning, and haue no preiudicat minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Common Law, to ſée two ſuch Noble Sciences as the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſticall Law are, ſo to be diſgraced, as that there is no more reckoning made of them, or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, than if they were matters and men of no worth, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16472:124"/>
fit or apt for no ſeruice in the common wealth: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the vſe of them is ſo neceſſarie, as that the common wealth cannot want the ſeruice of them in matters of great importance to the State, which (if the profeſſion ſhould come to a downefall, as it is like ſhortly to doe, if it be no more cheriſhed and made of than it is) will be ſooner ſéene by the want of them, than is now perceiued by the hauing of them; and then perhaps, will the State lament for the loſſe of ſuch a goodly Profeſſion, when it will bee hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered againe, as the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> did for the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> when they had in one day ſlaine well nigh the whole number of them.</p>
